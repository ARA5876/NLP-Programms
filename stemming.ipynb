See\\r\\n    Frontispiece, Plate 1\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA SCULPTURED REBUKE TO COMPULSORY VACCINATION\\r\\n\\r\\n    Compulsory Vaccination is an instance of a law which inflicts\\r\\n    actual disease and possible death on the human body and\\r\\n    propagates and disseminates deadly infections widely upon\\r\\n    animals and mankind. This is surely a glaring instance of a law\\r\\n    which is not based on Wisdom or Sanity and is a Menace to the\\r\\n    Health and Security of Humanity and the State.\\r\\n\\r\\n    “This amazing act is the homicidal insanity of a whole\\r\\n    profession. This is blood assassination.”\\r\\n\\r\\n  Dr. James J. Garth Wilkinson, 1876.\\r\\n\\r\\n    “It is unwise for the physician to force the operation upon\\r\\n    those who are unwilling, or to give assurances of absolute\\r\\n    harmlessness.”\\r\\n\\r\\n  Dr. Osler’s “Modern Medicine,” 1913, Vol. I, page 848.\\r\\n\\r\\n    “Vaccination is not always a harmless procedure; it must be\\r\\n    looked upon as the production of an acute infectious disease.”\\r\\n\\r\\n  Dr. Milton J. Rosenau, 1914.\\r\\n\\r\\n    “Against the body of a healthy man Parliament has no right of\\r\\n    assault whatever, under pretence of the public health.”\\r\\n\\r\\n  Professor F. W. Newman, of Oxford.\\r\\n\\r\\n    “Vaccination is a delusion, its penal enforcement a crime.”\\r\\n\\r\\n  Professor Alfred Russel Wallace, in “The Wonderful Century,” 1899.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPUBLIC CHALLENGE TO HEALTH DEPARTMENTS\\r\\n\\r\\nDEATHS FROM VACCINATION DENIED AND CONCEALED\\r\\n\\r\\nMORE DEATHS FROM VACCINATION THAN FROM SMALLPOX\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIN order that there shall be no misunderstanding about the serious\\r\\ncharge which I bring against vaccination, as being now actually more\\r\\ndangerous to public health and human life than natural smallpox,\\r\\nand the equally serious charge which I make against vaccinating\\r\\ndoctors--who now control our Departments of Health and Vital\\r\\nStatistics--of denying and concealing these facts from the people,\\r\\nI now issue this special challenge to the Departments of Health of\\r\\nthe City and State of New York, which cover a population of eleven\\r\\nmillions, and with whose records I am more familiar, that I will\\r\\nundertake to prove from their death certificates and vital records,\\r\\nnow concealed and withheld from the public, that there have been more\\r\\ndeaths from vaccination than from smallpox _in every year_ for the past\\r\\nfifteen years in the City and State of New York. If they deny the truth\\r\\nof these charges I further solemnly challenge them to open their now\\r\\nconcealed records to public examination and I will prove the truth of\\r\\nmy charges from these records.

S.\\r\\n    Constitution, Articles IX and X, 1789._\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nKEYNOTE NO. 3: SOVEREIGN RIGHTS OF THE PEOPLE.\\r\\n\\r\\n    Under our Basic Charters, just quoted, the sovereign right and\\r\\n    power rests in the People, and the Government has no rights or\\r\\n    powers, whatever, except as conferred by the People. QUESTION:\\r\\n    Where have our State or National Governments obtained the\\r\\n    right to force any medical remedy or operation upon citizens\\r\\n    against their will and consent? Where have these governments\\r\\n    obtained the right or power to force an infectious and deadly\\r\\n    disease upon the human body in defiance of the will and the\\r\\n    right of the citizen? Have the people ever given up their\\r\\n    most sacred essential and unalienable right to the sanctity\\r\\n    and security of their own bodies and to their free choice and\\r\\n    right of selection in the medical treatment of their bodies?\\r\\n    This is surely one of the great “unalienable,” “reserved” and\\r\\n    “retained” rights which the people have never given up to any\\r\\n    government, and which the Legislature or police power has no\\r\\n    right to invade. _C. M. H._\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nKEYNOTE NO. 4: PREËMINENT RIGHTS OF THE INDIVIDUAL DECLARED BY U. S.\\r\\nSUPREME COURT.\\r\\n\\r\\n    “There is, of course, a sphere within which the individual may\\r\\n    assert the supremacy of his own will, and rightfully dispute\\r\\n    the authority of any human government, especially of any free\\r\\n    government existing under a written constitution, to interfere\\r\\n    with the exercise of that will.” _U. S. Supreme Court in\\r\\n    Vaccination case of Jacobson, 1904._ Note: This decision also\\r\\n    held that vaccination could not be legally forced upon any\\r\\n    persons who could show that it was dangerous to their health or\\r\\n    life.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nKEYNOTE NO. 5: COMPULSORY VACCINATION IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL.\\r\\n\\r\\n    “It may be conceded that the Legislature has no constitutional\\r\\n    right to compel any person to submit to vaccination.” _Judge\\r\\n    Woodward, of New York Appellate Court, in Viemeister case in\\r\\n    1903._\\r\\n\\r\\n    “If the Commissioner of Health had the power to imprison an\\r\\n    individual for refusing to submit to vaccination, I see no\\r\\n    reason why he should not also imprison one for refusing to\\r\\n    swallow a dose. But the Legislature has conferred no such power\\r\\n    upon him, if, indeed, it has the power to do the like.” _Judge\\r\\n    Gaynor in Supreme Court, Brooklyn, N. Y., 1894, case of Smith\\r\\n    vs. Emery._ This decision was fully sustained by the Court of\\r\\n    Appeals.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nKEYNOTE NO. 6: MEDICAL COMPULSION AND DOMINATION JUDICIALLY REBUKED AND\\r\\nMEDICAL FREEDOM ASSERTED BY NEW YORK COURT OF APPEALS.\\r\\n\\r\\n    “I concur in Judge Chase’s construction of the statute. But I\\r\\n    would go farther. I deny the power of the Legislature to make\\r\\n    it a crime to treat disease by prayer.” _Decision of Chief\\r\\n    Justice Willard Bartlett, of New York Court of Appeals, in\\r\\n    “Christian Science” case of Willis Vernon Cole, 1917._\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nKEYNOTE NO. 7: GOVERNMENT HAS NO RIGHT TO FORCE A MEDICAL DISEASE OR\\r\\nOPERATION UPON THE PEOPLE.\\r\\n\\r\\n    From these decisions it would seem to be obvious that it cannot\\r\\n    be made a crime to refuse a medical operation to which the\\r\\n    patient does not consent or approve, and which is dangerous\\r\\n    to health or life, and that this is the “sphere,” as stated\\r\\n    by the U. S. Supreme Court, “within which the individual may\\r\\n    assert the supremacy of his own will and rightfully dispute\\r\\n    the authority of any human government ... to interfere with\\r\\n    the exercise of that will.” And, furthermore, this “sphere,”\\r\\n    surely means the “Unalienable rights” of the people asserted\\r\\n    in the Declaration and the “reserved” rights and powers\\r\\n    retained by the people as expressed in Articles IX and X of the\\r\\n    Constitution. _C. M. H._\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nKEYNOTE NO. 8: THE JEFFERSONIAN OATH OF RATIONAL AMERICAN LIBERTY.\\r\\n\\r\\n    “I have sworn upon the altar of God, eternal hostility against\\r\\n    every form of tyranny over the mind of man.” _Thomas Jefferson,\\r\\n    Author of Declaration of Independence, to Benjamin Rush, Signer\\r\\n    of the Declaration._\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nKEYNOTE NO. 9: MEDICAL FREEDOM IS AN INALIENABLE AMERICAN RIGHT.\\r\\n\\r\\n    The right of the individual to select any preferred system\\r\\n    of medical treatment, whether with or without prayer and\\r\\n    faith, with or without drugs and medicines, or with or without\\r\\n    vaccines or serums, and the right to accept or refuse any\\r\\n    medical remedy or operation, is surely a clear inherent and\\r\\n    reserved right, under our basic American Charters of Rights\\r\\n    and Liberties, and cannot be legally or morally denied, but\\r\\n    must be respected, defended and enforced by all Governments.\\r\\n    Indeed, our first and Basic Charter--The Declaration of\\r\\n    Rights--clearly and emphatically asserts that the essential\\r\\n    purpose of Government is to secure these inalienable rights\\r\\n    of the individual. Jefferson taught that Liberty, in all\\r\\n    essential needs, is not a “privilege” granted by Government,\\r\\n    but an inherent right possessed by all men, and naturally or\\r\\n    divinely conferred upon them; hence the chief function of all\\r\\n    Governments is to secure and enforce these human rights, not\\r\\n    to invade or violate them to satisfy medical dogmas or other\\r\\n    oppressive, dangerous, and illegal theories. _C. M. H._\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nKEYNOTE NO. 10: CONCLUSION: ABOLISH FORCED VACCINATION.\\r\\n\\r\\n    All Compulsory Vaccination should be abolished as being illegal\\r\\n    and unconstitutional and more dangerous to public health and\\r\\n    human life than natural disease, and therefore a medical\\r\\n    outrage and crime upon the people.\\r\\n\\r\\n    The Declaration of Rights distinctly asserts that: “Whenever\\r\\n    any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is\\r\\n    the right of the people to alter or to abolish it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n    The “ends” here referred to are the natural “unalienable” and\\r\\n    “reserved” rights of the people, which are grossly violated\\r\\n    by Compulsory Vaccination, and it is therefore the moral,\\r\\n    legal and constitutional right of the people to demand the\\r\\n    abolishment of this medical evil of compulsory disease which\\r\\n    obviously violates their most sacred and essential personal\\r\\n    rights, viz.: Sanctity of Body, Medical Liberty and Choice,\\r\\n    Health and Life.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTEXT OF PROPOSED LAW TO ABOLISH COMPULSORY VACCINATION.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No form of vaccination or inoculation shall be compulsory on any\\r\\nperson or be made a condition for the exercise of any right, privilege,\\r\\nor duty, of any person.”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCONTENTS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                                                                    PAGE\\r\\n  Statue and Motto of Wisdom and Law.

In Memoriam. Portrait of John Pitcairn, late President of\\r\\n  The Anti-Vaccination League of America and leading businessman\\r\\n  of Philadelphia                                                     72\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nINTRODUCTION\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHIS little book on the Horrors of Compulsory Vaccination, its medical\\r\\nbarbarism, and its moral and legal atrocity as a gross violation of\\r\\nBasic Personal and Broad American Rights, is dedicated and addressed to\\r\\nour esteemed President, Woodrow Wilson, for several decisive reasons:\\r\\n\\r\\n    FIRST: Because I believe him to be the most potent personality\\r\\n    in public office to-day and our greatest present representative\\r\\n    and exponent of Fundamental American Principles and Basic Human\\r\\n    Rights, and as being now recognized as a world-wide exponent of\\r\\n    these principles both at home and abroad.\\r\\n\\r\\n    SECOND: Because the President is Commander-in-Chief of the\\r\\n    Army and Navy and is thus invested with supreme commanding and\\r\\n    pardoning power, through which he can bring about an immediate\\r\\n    reform in the evil practice of compulsory vaccination by\\r\\n    pardoning, at his discretion, all men in the Army or Navy now\\r\\n    unjustly condemned by Court Martial for refusing vaccination,\\r\\n    and by abolishing all compulsion and making all vaccination\\r\\n    free and voluntary, as it now is in the English Army.\\r\\n\\r\\n    THIRD: Because the President is our highest civilian officer\\r\\n    and represents in his person and office one of our most\\r\\n    important American principles, the supremacy of the civil\\r\\n    over the military power. It therefore seemed to me most fit\\r\\n    and proper to appeal to our chief civilian officer on any\\r\\n    great question which concerns the most fundamental civil\\r\\n    rights of the citizen or involves any great abuse of military\\r\\n    power, as is the case with this evil practice of compulsory\\r\\n    vaccination. And I think it will be readily admitted that\\r\\n    _medical militarism_, such as the arbitrary medical compulsion\\r\\n    which forces and inflicts disease upon the human body, under\\r\\n    the fallacy of medical necessity and the pressure of military\\r\\n    law, is surely one of the most dangerous and oppressive forms\\r\\n    of extreme militarism that can be conceived and is not in\\r\\n    accordance with the spirit of American Institutions, and should\\r\\n    be suppressed. While, therefore, I, as a student of this\\r\\n    subject, may earnestly and persistently write and urge, and\\r\\n    demonstrate the truth on this subject, and prove by undeniable\\r\\n    fact, exhibit, and argument the dangerous nature of compulsory\\r\\n    vaccination and the shocking falsehoods on which it is based\\r\\n    as to its alleged efficacy, necessity and harmlessness, yet I\\r\\n    have not the least power or discretion to remove this evil;\\r\\n    whereas the power of the President in this matter is plenary,\\r\\n    instant and complete, so that in almost the twinkling of an eye\\r\\n    he can abolish this evil in the Army and Navy with one word\\r\\n    from his lips or one wave of his hand. And if this evil is once\\r\\n    abolished in the Army and Navy, its abolishment everywhere else\\r\\n    throughout the land is sure to follow, with great advantage\\r\\n    to human right and much improvement in public health, as has\\r\\n    resulted wherever this medical malpractice of inoculation\\r\\n    with inflicted disease has been reduced or abolished, with a\\r\\n    corresponding increase in sanitation and hygiene.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor these good reasons, I have therefore thought it most\\r\\nproper and advisable to make this appeal to our highest civilian\\r\\nofficial and our Chief Military Commander, who is so potently equipped\\r\\nto give the immediate relief and establish the reform herein asked\\r\\nfor, viz., the full Medical Freedom to accept or refuse vaccination\\r\\nas each individual sees fit, which is a basic and inherent American\\r\\nright; and I therefore now submit the numerous and conclusive facts\\r\\nand demonstrations in these pages for the special consideration of\\r\\nthe President and the general attention of the People and their\\r\\nRepresentatives in our National and State Legislatures, and as a full\\r\\njustification of the reform prayed for.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn conclusion, I might say that I first began this work as a simple\\r\\nLetter of Petition to the President to abolish forced vaccination in\\r\\nthe Army and Navy, with a brief outline of reasons for this reform,\\r\\nwhich letter was commenced before the President sailed for Europe to\\r\\nattend the World Peace Conference. But the importance and scope of the\\r\\nsubject grew as I worked on it, and I concluded to expand the letter\\r\\ninto a full illustration and demonstration of the Horrors of Compulsory\\r\\nVaccination, its failures, falsehoods, futilities and fatalities, which\\r\\nwould be so thorough and convincing that it could not be disregarded.\\r\\nThis enlarged work has required nearly twelve months to complete and\\r\\nmake ready for the consideration of the President after his return from\\r\\nthe Peace Conference, and its publication has been much delayed by\\r\\nseveral unavoidable conditions, including the recent great strike in\\r\\nthe printing trades.\\r\\n\\r\\nI might further state in conclusion that I have spent a lifetime and a\\r\\nfortune in the study and investigation of this subject and in efforts\\r\\nfor the repeal of all unwise laws for forcing vaccination upon the\\r\\npeople, which repeal is now being agitated and is progressing all over\\r\\nthe civilized world. And as I probably shall not be able to work many\\r\\nmore years in this great cause of Medical Freedom, and as this may be\\r\\nmy last contribution to the cause, I have concluded to make the case\\r\\nagainst Compulsory Vaccination so full and complete in this Exposure\\r\\nthat there can be no question of its medical malpractice and its\\r\\ndangerous, deadly and illegal nature.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor these reasons I have also thought it my duty to give to the public\\r\\nthe benefit of my studies of a lifetime and the accumulation of the\\r\\nmany shocking facts, proofs and exhibits which I have been collecting\\r\\nfor years, and which, as now massed in the Petition and its Illustrated\\r\\nSupplement, can, I think, leave no doubt in the mind of any reasonable\\r\\nman or woman--not professionally interested in vaccination--that all\\r\\nCompulsory Vaccination should be immediately abolished, and that its\\r\\ncontinuation, with these proofs against it, would be a most gross\\r\\nmedical blunder and malpractice and a grave violation of the basic\\r\\nAmerican principle of Inherent Individual Rights, in being a serious\\r\\nmenace to human health and life, a frequent cause of wide-spread\\r\\nepidemics and demonstrably more fatal in many instances than natural\\r\\ndisease itself, and therefore a shocking violation of all true medical\\r\\nethics and a disgrace alike to modern medicine and modern legislation\\r\\nwhich should no longer tolerate the practice.\\r\\n\\r\\n  CHAS.

M. HIGGINS\\r\\n  _of Brooklyn, N. Y.\\r\\n  a citizen of the United States_\\r\\n\\r\\n  TO\\r\\n  THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES\\r\\n  _Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy\\r\\n  Washington, D. C._\\r\\n\\r\\n  Mr. President:\\r\\n\\r\\nAmerican History, as you well know, tells us that our first President,\\r\\nthe illustrious George Washington, died in 1799 as the result of a\\r\\nmedical malpractice common at that time, viz., the barbarous and\\r\\ndangerous practice of indiscriminate bleeding to cure disease. While\\r\\nsuffering from an attack of acute sore throat or laryngitis, the\\r\\npatient was so weakened by the great loss of vital fluid in repeated\\r\\nbleeding operations that he was not able to endure this loss and\\r\\novercome also the effects of the disease. Our great Washington thus\\r\\ngave up his glorious life--glorious in the establishment of American\\r\\nLiberty and the principles of Inalienable Natural Rights of the\\r\\nIndividual as a basis for all Government--on the altar of medical\\r\\nbarbarism and malpractice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHISTORIC WARNING IN THE DEATH OF OUR FIRST PRESIDENT FROM MEDICAL\\r\\nMALPRACTICE\\r\\n\\r\\nLet us now take this warning from the medical barbarism of the past,\\r\\neven over such a long interval of time, as a fit warning against the\\r\\nmedical malpractices and barbarisms of to-day, which are even more\\r\\nirrational and dangerous to human right and safety, health and life\\r\\nthan the malpractice of the past which destroyed the life of our first\\r\\nPresident.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCOMPULSORY VACCINATION THE GREAT MEDICAL MALPRACTICE OF TO-DAY WHICH\\r\\nKILLS MANY WHERE BLEEDING KILLED ONE\\r\\n\\r\\nNow the most barbarous and dangerous medical practice of to-day is the\\r\\ngross evil of compulsory vaccination, which is doubtless the greatest\\r\\nviolation of common sense, medical propriety and the unalienable\\r\\nnatural rights of the individual guaranteed in our basic American\\r\\nCharters, that any dogmatic, presumptuous profession or class of\\r\\nmen has ever been guilty of. And it is to this serious violation of\\r\\nAmerican principle forced on our soldiers and sailors by medical\\r\\ndogmatism that I now wish to ask your most careful attention as one\\r\\nhaving the supreme commanding and pardoning power in Army and Navy,\\r\\nwith the earnest prayer that in the exercise of that exalted wisdom and\\r\\npower possessed by your great American Office and Personality, which\\r\\nhas now made itself felt around the whole world, that this medical\\r\\nbarbarism of compulsory disease may be abolished in our Army and Navy,\\r\\nand that all men condemned by Court Martial for refusing the infliction\\r\\non their bodies of compulsory disease shall be fully pardoned and\\r\\nrestored to their proper and honorable status as loyal American\\r\\nsoldiers and sailors. And I now wish to present to you in the following\\r\\npages an abundant array of facts and evidence which prove, I think,\\r\\nbeyond doubt, the great evil and danger of vaccination, its fatality,\\r\\nand futility, and clearly justify the rational reform suggested for the\\r\\nabolishment of all forced or compulsory vaccination.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE MODERN MEDICAL BARBARISM POISONS THE BLOOD IN THE BODY INSTEAD OF\\r\\nDRAINING THE BLOOD OUT OF THE BODY\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this medical malpractice of to-day the doctors do not open the\\r\\nveins and drain out the life blood of the patient, ostensibly to cure\\r\\nhis disease, as in the mistaken past, but they now keep this blood in\\r\\nthe body and inject into it directly or indirectly various more or\\r\\nless virulent diseases, blood poisons, or disease germs, cultures or\\r\\nproducts, either living or dead, with the idea of curing or preventing\\r\\nsome natural disease. These practices are called, respectively,\\r\\n“vaccination” and “serum treatment.” In vaccination an actual living or\\r\\ndead disease germ, or virus, is injected into the blood, lymph, skin or\\r\\nmuscle; whereas, in serum or antitoxin treatment a disease product or\\r\\nculture is so injected.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nVACCINATION THE MOST DANGEROUS AND REPULSIVE SYSTEM OF MEDICATION EVER\\r\\nDEVISED\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, whatever merits or demerits this system of disease inoculation\\r\\nmay have, either in preventing or curing or immunizing against natural\\r\\ndisease, I will not here say and do not need to here discuss, except to\\r\\nstate that such curative or preventive power has been much exaggerated\\r\\nand is very limited and uncertain. But whatever these merits or\\r\\ndemerits may be, it is obvious on fundamental principles of medical and\\r\\ncivic ethics, that such a dangerous and repugnant practice of disease\\r\\ninoculation and blood poisoning should not be made compulsory on any\\r\\nperson for any excuse whatever. It must be here remembered that it was\\r\\nadmitted that the old smallpox inoculation had a certain preventive\\r\\npower and yet it was finally condemned and abandoned for reasons of\\r\\nits great danger as causing more disease and death than it prevented.\\r\\nDisregarding, therefore, the question of preventive merits or demerits,\\r\\nI think I can now say with perfect truth and soberness, and without\\r\\nfear of refutation, that this modern system of compulsory vaccination\\r\\nis the most violent and dangerous and most immoral or unethical system\\r\\nof medication that has ever been devised by a most honorable yet most\\r\\npresumptuous profession which has been proved guilty of the most\\r\\ngigantic medical mistakes in its past history of the centuries, one\\r\\nof which--indiscriminate bleeding--as we have already seen, killed\\r\\nour first President and many other victims of that period. To this\\r\\ngigantic and abandoned mistake we might now add the two horrible\\r\\npractices of smallpox inoculation and arm-to-arm vaccination, both of\\r\\nwhich were once used and approved by the highest medical authority\\r\\nas safe and infallible preventives of natural disease, yet both were\\r\\nfinally abandoned as great medical mistakes and were prohibited by\\r\\npenal law as most risky methods of propagating and extending disease\\r\\nand more dangerous to human health and life than the natural disease\\r\\nitself.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nVACCINATION IS BLOOD POISONING WITH INFLICTED DISEASE AND IS OFTEN MORE\\r\\nFATAL THAN NATURAL DISEASE\\r\\n\\r\\nFor these former medical mistakes there is now substituted the modern\\r\\nmedical mistake of compulsory bovine and serum vaccinations of various\\r\\nkinds and multiple repetitions which are in many instances as dangerous\\r\\nto human health and life as the former prohibited malpractices, or\\r\\nmore so, and will, doubtless, in due time, be publicly condemned and\\r\\nabandoned as equal mistakes, like their predecessors.\\r\\n\\r\\nIndeed, this modern vaccine system of medicine is so violent and\\r\\ndangerous that it has been frequently known to kill in from ten to\\r\\nfifteen minutes, after injection of the serum, by what is known as\\r\\n“serum sickness,” which is a kind of rapid blood and nerve poisoning\\r\\naffecting vital nerve centers, to which some persons are very\\r\\nsusceptible.[1] This is, of course, a more violent, rapid and fatal\\r\\naction than occurs in the most virulent and deadly natural diseases and\\r\\nis comparable only to a stroke of lightning or shock of electricity or\\r\\nto the violent action of the most virulent chemical, mineral, animal,\\r\\nor vegetable poisons known in toxicology. In other fatal cases, where\\r\\nthe poisoning action is slower, death finally occurs from lockjaw,\\r\\nparalysis, meningitis, or pneumonia, which are frequent results of\\r\\nvaccination. And these fatal results of vaccination are commonly\\r\\ndenied and concealed in death certificates by recording the terminal\\r\\ndisease of lockjaw, paralysis, meningitis, or pneumonia only as the\\r\\nsole and original cause of death without any record of the inflicted\\r\\ndisease--vaccination--as the primary or contributory cause of the\\r\\ndeath. This evil practice is, of course, a gross falsification of\\r\\nour vital statistics, and is now a frequent offense by some of our\\r\\nvaccinating doctors, as I can legally prove by documentary evidence\\r\\nwhen required.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn some death certificates, however, the vaccination is more or less\\r\\nclearly and honestly acknowledged as the cause of death, direct or\\r\\nindirect. I have now in hand a recent New York death certificate which\\r\\nrecords the death of a little child one year old in three days after\\r\\nvaccination from vaccinal septicemia, or blood poisoning, due to the\\r\\nvaccinal infection.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEVERY VACCINATION SORE IS AN INFECTING ABSCESS AND EVERY ACT OF\\r\\nVACCINATION IS A BLOOD INFECTION CAPABLE OF CAUSING SERIOUS DISEASE OR\\r\\nDEATH AT ANY TIME\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd let me here say that every vaccination sore is simply a septicemic\\r\\nabscess and focus of infection, more or less dangerous, and is possibly\\r\\ncapable of infecting the whole system at any time with fatal effect;\\r\\nand, furthermore, every act of ordinary cowpox vaccination is, of\\r\\ncourse, an act of septicemic infection or blood poisoning, _per se_,\\r\\nand pure and simple, and frequently kills in this way in the longer or\\r\\nshorter time of a few days, which is, of course, quicker than the worst\\r\\nforms of natural smallpox ever kill. See Figs. 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, pages\\r\\n83 to 88. On this point see also the “Manual of Causes of Death,” by\\r\\nU. S. Census Bureau, page 56, No. 20, and the corresponding Manual of\\r\\nthe Registrar General of England, in which vaccination is recorded as a\\r\\nform of septicemia and a serious cause of death.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs further convincing evidence on this head, I have a Brooklyn death\\r\\ncertificate showing the death of a woman hospital nurse six months\\r\\nafter vaccination, from multiple abscesses which broke out all over the\\r\\nbody in successive crops and continued for six months notwithstanding\\r\\nthe most skillful medical efforts for cure, and finally resulted in\\r\\ndeath from general vaccinal septicemia. See Figs. 11, 12 and 13, which\\r\\nshow other cases of this kind.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have an English certificate showing the death of a man from the same\\r\\ncause, multiple abscesses, resulting from vaccination and continuing\\r\\nfor seven years, and finally ending in death from this cause.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have also another English certificate which shows the death of a\\r\\nlittle infant from vaccinal septicemia in thirty-four hours after\\r\\nvaccination! Of course the worst form of smallpox was never known to\\r\\nkill in such short time.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese shocking facts thus clearly show that an inflicted disease may be\\r\\nfar worse and more fatal than a naturally acquired disease, and that\\r\\nvaccination may kill with surprising swiftness in a few days, hours,\\r\\nor minutes, quicker than the most fatal natural diseases or the most\\r\\nvirulent poisons, or may continue a most horrible blood infection with\\r\\ninternal or external eruptions through an agony of months or years and\\r\\nfinally end in death from this infection.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have also some recent American death certificates which show the\\r\\ndeaths of five little children of primary school age, all killed in\\r\\none week in September, 1915, from vaccination resulting in lockjaw\\r\\nand septicemia. I have now in hand a memorial pamphlet written by an\\r\\naggrieved father, a very intelligent man, an editor and manufacturer,\\r\\nMr. James A. Loyster, of Cazenovia, New York, which shows the death of\\r\\nhis own son and about thirty other children from vaccination in New\\r\\nYork State in 1914. This child slaughter was the result of a general\\r\\nvaccination raid made upon the school children of the State in that\\r\\nyear; and this pamphlet gives convincing proof that about thirty, and\\r\\nprobable proof that about twice that number, were killed by vaccine\\r\\ninfection, _while only three persons died from smallpox in the whole\\r\\nState for the same year_! See pages 145 to 163, which give several\\r\\npages of this pamphlet in full.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCOMPULSORY VACCINATION AS A CONDITION FOR PUBLIC SCHOOLING OR\\r\\nFOR SERVICE IN ARMY AND NAVY IS MEDICALLY BARBAROUS AND LEGALLY\\r\\nUNCONSTITUTIONAL, AND SHOULD BE ABOLISHED\\r\\n\\r\\nThese deadly vaccinations above cited were almost all performed on\\r\\nschool children to satisfy an evil law which has been originated and\\r\\nsustained by a powerful but mistaken part or sect of the medical\\r\\nprofession--the vaccine sect--by which law vaccination is forced\\r\\nupon children of school age as a condition for admission to school,\\r\\nthus making the infliction of a dangerous disease on the tender body\\r\\nof the child a condition for the exercise of that most essential,\\r\\nunquestionable, and inalienable right of the child to _Education_!\\r\\nSuch invasion of natural right to life, health, and education is\\r\\nsurely the clearest violation of those great American principles of\\r\\ninherent natural rights so distinctly set forth in the Declaration and\\r\\nConstitution which all Governments must respect and defend, as I will\\r\\nshow later on.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nABOLISH ALL COMPULSORY VACCINATION IN ARMY AND NAVY AND APPOINT DOCTORS\\r\\nOF VARIOUS SCHOOLS ON ALL MEDICAL AND HEALTH BOARDS\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the same way this dogmatic and dominant part or sect of the\\r\\nmedical profession, organized in powerful medical societies and now\\r\\ncontrolling important public offices, has forced the dangerous practice\\r\\nof general compulsory vaccination upon our Army and Navy, and this\\r\\npractice is, I believe, largely the result of having only one school of\\r\\nmedicine--the vaccine school--represented on our Medical Boards and in\\r\\nour Departments of Health and Vital Statistics. To thus have only one\\r\\nschool of medicine represented on our Medical Boards of Army and Navy\\r\\nis, I submit, as great a mistake, as unjust, absurd, and un-American,\\r\\nas it would be to have only one school of Religion represented in our\\r\\nArmy and Navy chaplains. For, surely, medical tolerance and freedom is\\r\\nas important for national welfare as religious tolerance and freedom.\\r\\nAnd to this particular point, Mr. President, I would, therefore, now\\r\\nlike to ask your first and most careful attention, with the suggestion\\r\\nand hope that, as supreme commander of both arms of the service, you\\r\\nwill not only find it just, wise, and proper to abolish all compulsory\\r\\nvaccination in Army and Navy and leave vaccination entirely voluntary\\r\\nwith each man, as it now is in the English Army, but that you will also\\r\\nabolish all arrogant monopoly or control of medical practice in Army\\r\\nand Navy by any one school of medicine, and will adopt the reform in\\r\\nthe future of having various schools of medicine properly and justly\\r\\nrepresented on our Medical Boards, from which reform, I believe, a\\r\\ngreat improvement in medical practice and in public right, health, and\\r\\ncomfort is sure to result.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCRUEL AND UNUSUAL, EXCESSIVE AND UNREASONABLE PUNISHMENTS ARE\\r\\nUNCONSTITUTIONAL. MORAL AND MEDICAL MONSTROSITY OF LONG TERMS OF\\r\\nIMPRISONMENT FOR REFUSING VACCINATION\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this point I would like to call your careful attention to a news\\r\\nitem which appeared in the _New York Times_ of May 2, 1918, as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n  “_Refused Vaccination, Got Fifteen Years._\\r\\n\\r\\n    “Camp Dodge, Iowa, May 1.--Elmer N. Olson, of Goodrich, Minn.,\\r\\n    a soldier in training here, refused to submit to vaccination.\\r\\n    He was tried by general court-martial and sentenced to fifteen\\r\\n    years in the disciplinary barracks at Fort Leavenworth.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is only one of many similar items which have appeared in the press\\r\\nfor the last two years, showing that it has been a practice in the\\r\\narmy to try soldiers by court-martial for refusing to be vaccinated\\r\\nagainst free will and consent; and to degrade them from honorable\\r\\nmilitary service merely for this refusal, and condemn them to long\\r\\nterms of imprisonment such as are given only to dangerous and felonious\\r\\ncriminals under the criminal law,--and it is shown in this item that\\r\\nthe extraordinary punishment of fifteen years’ imprisonment was thus\\r\\ninflicted for the sole offense of refusing compulsory vaccination! It\\r\\nmay be that in some cases other offenses besides mere refusal to be\\r\\nvaccinated were involved, but I understand from several news items that\\r\\nonly the act of refusal to submit to forced vaccination was involved in\\r\\nmany such condemnations.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn answer to a special request for information on this point, I have\\r\\nbeen informed by the office of the Judge Advocate General, in a\\r\\nletter dated January 14, 1919, that there was only one instance of\\r\\ncourt-martial for refusing to be vaccinated in the years 1917 and\\r\\n1918, that this was held to be a violation of the 96th Article of War,\\r\\nand that the offender in this case was sentenced to be “_Dishonorably\\r\\ndischarged from the service, to forfeit all pay and allowances due or\\r\\nto become due, and to be confined at hard labor at such place as the\\r\\nconvening authority may direct for twenty-five years_.”\\r\\n\\r\\nNow I respectfully submit, Mr. President, that whether there were\\r\\none or many cases of this kind, they were clearly cases of “cruel\\r\\nand unusual” and excessive and unreasonable punishment and also an\\r\\n“unreasonable search and seizure of the person,” condemned in the\\r\\nConstitution in Articles IV and VIII of the Amendments, as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n    ARTICLE IV. “The right of the people to be secure in their\\r\\n    persons ... against unreasonable searches and seizures shall\\r\\n    not be violated.”\\r\\n\\r\\n    ARTICLE VIII. “Excessive bail shall not be required, nor\\r\\n    excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments\\r\\n    inflicted.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI therefore think it is perfectly obvious that to thus degrade a loyal\\r\\nand honorable soldier and condemn him like a felonious criminal to the\\r\\nlong term of fifteen or twenty-five years’ imprisonment, merely for the\\r\\nact of refusing to have a dangerous medical operation and an inflicted\\r\\ndisease forced upon his body against his will and consent, is clearly\\r\\nan “unreasonable seizure” of the person and a “cruel and unusual” and\\r\\nexcessive and unreasonable punishment prohibited in the Constitution;\\r\\nand I think that no further argument is necessary to prove this point.\\r\\nSurely to inflict such drastic punishments as above shown--not for any\\r\\nreally criminal, immoral, or perfidious act--not for anything that\\r\\nreally affects the purely military duties, qualities, or services of\\r\\nany loyal, honorable and healthy soldier--but simply for opposing a\\r\\ndangerous medical dogma and defending his body against an inflicted\\r\\ndisease and a dangerous medical operation which frequently sickens and\\r\\nunfits the soldier for a long time afterwards for military service and\\r\\nsometimes actually kills--as already clearly proved--surely, I say,\\r\\nsuch a punishment is not only legally unconstitutional, but is morally\\r\\nbarbarous in both a true military and true medical sense, and should\\r\\nbe abolished in both Army and Navy for the several reasons herein\\r\\nsubmitted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHARSH MILITARY PUNISHMENTS CONDEMNED BY AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the _New York Tribune_ of January 4, 1919, the President of the\\r\\nAmerican Bar Association, at a meeting in New York City on January\\r\\n3d, condemned harsh and unjust judgments of military courts-martial,\\r\\nand stated that “_our military laws and our systems of administering\\r\\nmilitary justice are unworthy of the name of law or justice_.” He\\r\\nalso said that our army was still following rules copied from England\\r\\nin 1774, but which were abandoned long ago as better suited “_to\\r\\nthe armies of feudal times than to the citizen armies of a modern\\r\\nrepublic_.” He also condemned “the outrageous punishments meted out\\r\\nby our courts-martial for comparatively slight breaches of military\\r\\ndiscipline.” And he further stated that “Punishments are not only\\r\\ngrossly harsh, as compared with the penalties imposed for like offences\\r\\nby our criminal courts, but they also differ so widely that we find\\r\\nthe same offence punished in one court-martial by twenty-five years\\r\\nin the penitentiary and in another by six months in disciplinary\\r\\nbarracks.” ... “The accused soldier has no real legal protection.” ...\\r\\n“The maintenance of military discipline does not require this harsh\\r\\nand arbitrary procedure. The French army is a model of discipline, but\\r\\nan accused soldier has the protection of the law thrown around him\\r\\nat every stage of his trial. That a soldier in our army should have\\r\\nless legal protection challenges the attention of the lawyers of the\\r\\ncountry. The American people never will stand for Prussian methods even\\r\\nin disciplining the Army.”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMILITARY OBEDIENCE TO BAD LAW. THE HIGH EXAMPLE OF SOCRATES COMMENDED\\r\\n\\r\\nLest some false interpreter should suggest that in here condemning\\r\\ncompulsory vaccination in the Army and Navy and urging its abolishment\\r\\nI am attempting “_to incite insubordination, disloyalty, or mutiny,\\r\\nor refusal of duty, in the military or naval forces of the United\\r\\nStates_,” as expressed in the Overman Law, I would now call careful\\r\\nattention to the obvious fact that urging the abolition of a bad law,\\r\\nor petitioning government “for a redress of grievances,” is not urging\\r\\n_disobedience_ to any law, is not inciting mutiny or refusal of duty\\r\\nor disloyalty to the United States, but is a clear constitutional\\r\\nright under Article I of the first amendment, which right, it is there\\r\\nstated, cannot be abridged or denied.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf any loyal soldiers, opposed to forced vaccination, should ask my\\r\\nadvice whether they should accept or refuse it, I would advise them\\r\\nto protest against compulsion and ask for its abolition, but I would\\r\\nnot advise them to deliberately disobey any legal military rule. And\\r\\nI would further say here that I believe that any soldier who might\\r\\nbe injured or killed as a result of any vaccination, to which he was\\r\\nforced to submit by any military law, would suffer and die in the\\r\\nservice of his country with just as much honor as if he had died on the\\r\\nbattle-field; or with as much honor as in the case of Socrates, the\\r\\ngreat Grecian soldier and philosopher, who died in obedience to bad law\\r\\nand unjust judgment.\\r\\n\\r\\nI would further advise all conscientious objectors to forced\\r\\nvaccination to consider the teaching of some strict moralists, that it\\r\\nis better to obey all laws, however bad, than to disobey any of them,\\r\\nand that this _obedience_ and _sacrifice_ is the first duty of the\\r\\nsoldier and citizen. And it is also taught that this obedience to bad\\r\\nlaw, after full and due protest against it, is the best way to bring\\r\\nabout its repeal in due time.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis seems to have been the teaching of the great Socrates--the pagan\\r\\nChrist, 399 B.C.--and was the chief lesson of his tragic death. Knowing\\r\\nthat he was unjustly and falsely condemned and that his judges acted\\r\\nwrongly, yet within the forms of law, he refused to escape this false\\r\\nand unjust judgment, although he could easily have done so with the\\r\\nhelp of powerful friends who urged this upon him. Yet he nobly accepted\\r\\nthe judgment of law and drank the cup of poison to which he was legally\\r\\nbut wrongly sentenced, and thus gave up his life to vindicate what he\\r\\nbelieved was the sacred duty of the citizen to obey all laws, just or\\r\\nunjust, and the still more sacred duty of the lawmaker and the judge,\\r\\nthat all laws and judgments should be absolutely just and true and\\r\\nfaithful to all rights of the citizen. If, therefore, it be the first\\r\\nduty of the citizen and soldier to obey all law, good or bad, what a\\r\\nmuch greater duty is laid upon the lawmaker, the law enforcer, the\\r\\nJudge, and, we might also say, the Commander-in-Chief, that all law\\r\\nand all judgments be absolutely right, just and true, and in no way\\r\\ndestructive to the rights of the citizen or soldier who has to obey\\r\\nthese laws, good or bad! This was the grand lesson intended by Socrates\\r\\nin the sacrifice of his life as a protest and indictment against bad\\r\\nlaw and unjust judgment, and we may here, properly, apply this great\\r\\nSocratic lesson, which has morally thundered down “the corridors of\\r\\ntime” for the past twenty-four centuries, to all the evil laws for\\r\\ncompulsory vaccination which now exist and which should be immediately\\r\\nrepealed and replaced by just and equitable rules for voluntary\\r\\nvaccination only as proved by the many reasons already given.--“Every\\r\\nlaw not based on wisdom is a menace to the State.” See page v.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nVOICE OF THE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF TO OUR SOLDIERS, “YOU HAVE COMMANDERS,\\r\\nBUT YOU HAVE NO MASTERS.” RIGHTS AND DIGNITIES OF SOLDIERS ASSERTED.\\r\\nMILITARY AND MEDICAL DESPOTISM CONDEMNED\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this point, Mr. President, I want to remind you of the rich American\\r\\nthought you expressed in your address to the American soldiers on the\\r\\nbattle-field in France, at Chaumont, on Christmas Day, 1918. You were\\r\\nreported to have there said:\\r\\n\\r\\n    “... this is not a war in which the soldiers of the free\\r\\n    nations have obeyed masters. You have commanders, but you have\\r\\n    no masters. Your very commanders represent you in representing\\r\\n    the nation of which you constitute so distinguished a part.”\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, the true American thought in this quotation, as I take it, is\\r\\nthat, as American soldiers and citizens, they are free men and members\\r\\nof a free state, with American rights and dignities that cannot be\\r\\ninvaded, and are not “slaves,” “chattels,” or “subjects” to any one,\\r\\nand, therefore, are not to be treated by any form of military despotism\\r\\nor arbitrary medical dictation, as slaves, hogs, or cattle might be\\r\\nso treated. And as the hog or cattle doctor might properly force any\\r\\nmedicine down the throat of the helpless beast without being required\\r\\nto say “by your leave” to his humble patient, or might perform on the\\r\\nbody of the helpless animal any operation that he or the owner might\\r\\ndecide upon, yet I think that neither of us would admit that any man\\r\\ncalling himself a human doctor could, with any decency, propriety,\\r\\nor legality, follow this crude but necessary code of ethics of the\\r\\nanimal doctor on the human subject by attempting to perform any medical\\r\\nservice on the human body by any intimidation or force or without\\r\\nfull approval and consent of the patient. Yet what have we seen? We\\r\\nhave seen men, calling themselves doctors, claiming the right to\\r\\nforce dangerous medical operations on school children and soldiers\\r\\nwithout their free will and consent, and with some form of barbarous\\r\\nintimidation or coercion, as they might do with dangerous beasts. We\\r\\nhave seen loyal soldiers, conscientiously objecting to unnecessary\\r\\nand dangerous operations on their bodies against their approval or\\r\\nconsent, who were tried by court-martial and condemned to imprisonment\\r\\nat _hard labor for twenty-five years_! And this outrageous sentence was\\r\\ninflicted for nothing more than for asserting one of the most obvious\\r\\nand unalienable rights of every American--the right to the medical\\r\\nsanctity of his own body, the right to medical freedom, choice, and\\r\\nconsent in any medical treatment of that body!\\r\\n\\r\\nIs it not time, therefore, Mr. President, that this clear American\\r\\nprinciple expressed in your address just quoted should now be applied\\r\\nin this matter, and that this _Medical Hoggery_ of compulsory\\r\\nvaccination should be abolished in our Army and Navy? And is it not\\r\\ntime also that the members of that “Divine” profession of Human\\r\\nHealing, in all its schools and sects, should now take action at the\\r\\nearliest possible day to purge their great profession from the deep\\r\\ndisgrace of this _Medical Hoggery_, which they have originated and too\\r\\nlong practiced, and which is involved in all forms of dictatorial and\\r\\ncompulsory medicine on the human subject?\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course, in anything I say here I make no reflection on the\\r\\nveterinary doctors whose work, in its own sphere, I regard just as\\r\\nhonorable as the work of any other doctors in their sphere.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCOMPULSORY VACCINATION NOT NECESSARY AND NOT EFFECTIVE FOR THE HEALTH\\r\\nOF ARMIES OR POPULATIONS. FAILURE OF VACCINATION IN U. S. ARMY\\r\\nOFFICIALLY ADMITTED\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is another strong consideration which I think should move you,\\r\\nMr. President, toward abolishing this evil of compulsory vaccination\\r\\nwith “cruel and unusual” punishment, and that is: That this compulsion\\r\\nand punishment is not really necessary for any military purpose or\\r\\nefficiency, as is proved by several facts in the past and present\\r\\npractice and experience of our own and other armies, for example:\\r\\n_First_: In the Russian-Japanese war the Japanese adopted for almost\\r\\nthe first time the modern, effective system of general military\\r\\nsanitation and hygiene, but used no typhoid vaccination, and yet the\\r\\narmy suffered very little from typhoid fever. _Second_: Per contra,\\r\\nin the Gallipoli expedition in the recent war the English soldiers\\r\\nwere generally inoculated with typhoid vaccines, but at the same\\r\\ntime the most unsanitary conditions prevailed in camp and field,\\r\\nand the result was a great loss from typhoid and other fevers among\\r\\nthe vaccinated. _Third_: In the U. S. Army in France in 1918, in\\r\\nseveral camps where sanitation and hygiene were grossly neglected,\\r\\ntyphoid vaccination proved to be little or no protection, and it has\\r\\nbeen officially admitted to be a great failure, as typhoid epidemics\\r\\nprevailed extensively in said camps with a high death-rate among the\\r\\nwell vaccinated men. See official report on this subject from the\\r\\nChief Surgeon of the A. E. F. in U. S. Public Health Reports of March\\r\\n28, 1919, entitled, “Typhoid Vaccination no Substitute for Sanitary\\r\\nPrecautions.” See also page 207 in the annexed Supplement. _Fourth_:\\r\\nVaccination is now voluntary in the English Army, and it is estimated\\r\\nthat from five to ten per cent. of the Army is unvaccinated. _Fifth_:\\r\\nThere is no court-martial or punishment for refusing vaccination in\\r\\nthe English Army, as is shown by a recent inquiry in the English\\r\\nParliament, reported as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n    “Official Parliamentary Debates, April 23, 1918, Column 833.\\r\\n\\r\\n    “Mr. Chancellor asked the Under-Secretary for War, Mr.\\r\\n    Macpherson:\\r\\n\\r\\n    “_Question A._ Whether refusal of vaccination by any soldier\\r\\n    is a military crime. _Answer A._ Refusal by a soldier to be\\r\\n    vaccinated is not an offence punishable under the Army Act.\\r\\n\\r\\n    “_Question B._ Whether any officer is authorized to inflict\\r\\n    punishment of any kind for such refusal. _Answer B._ No officer\\r\\n    is authorized to inflict punishment for such refusal.\\r\\n\\r\\n    “_Question C._ Whether the fact of a man who joined when\\r\\n    vaccination was compulsory, having assented reluctantly then,\\r\\n    alters his legal position now that vaccination is no longer\\r\\n    subject to legal compulsion in the Army. _Answer C._ Soldiers\\r\\n    voluntarily enlisted who, at the time of their enlistment,\\r\\n    agreed in their attestation papers to be vaccinated, cannot be\\r\\n    punished under the Army Act for refusing to be vaccinated.”\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, in these facts I think it is distinctly proved that\\r\\ncompulsory vaccination is neither necessary nor surely effective as a\\r\\nprotective remedy, but is of doubtful value as a preventive, and is not\\r\\nnecessary where efficient sanitation and hygiene are used, as is now\\r\\nthe practice in modern armies; and, hence, vaccination should not be\\r\\nforced on any soldier or sailor under penalty of drastic punishments\\r\\nfor refusal, but should be left to the free and voluntary assent of\\r\\neach man, as it now is in the English Army. Furthermore, it is believed\\r\\nthat, instead of forcing wholesale compulsory disease upon the Army,\\r\\nwith the vain idea of increasing health, equal effort and expense\\r\\ndevoted to true sanitation and hygiene would surely produce better\\r\\nresults, as emphatically proved by recent critical experience in our\\r\\nown Army, as just cited. See also page 210.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMEDICAL AND OTHER AUTHORITIES ADMIT DANGERS OF VACCINATION AND CONDEMN\\r\\nCOMPULSION\\r\\n\\r\\nSurely the example of the English Army, as above given, is a good\\r\\nenough precedent and authority to justify abolishing all compulsion\\r\\nand penalties and making all vaccination voluntary in our American\\r\\nArmy and Navy, but if any other authorities are required for this\\r\\nreform, I might cite for a second example the advice from one of the\\r\\nhighest medical authorities of to-day, viz., Osler’s “Modern Medicine,”\\r\\nnew edition, 1913, Volume I, page 848, which admits the dangers of\\r\\nvaccination and condemns compulsion in these words:\\r\\n\\r\\n    “With the greatest care, however, certain risks are present\\r\\n    and so it is unwise for the physician to force the operation\\r\\n    upon those who are unwilling, or to give assurances of absolute\\r\\n    harmlessness.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI will now ask your attention to a third authority against\\r\\ncompulsion, which is of the highest significance and force, viz., the\\r\\ngreat English Commission on Vaccination appointed by Queen Victoria\\r\\nin 1889, which sat for about seven years, made a most exhaustive\\r\\nexamination of the subject, and rendered its voluminous reports in\\r\\n1896. This Commission was composed of five of the leading doctors and\\r\\neight of the leading laymen of England, and their majority and minority\\r\\nreports differed on the merits of vaccination, but both admitted its\\r\\ndangers and both agreed in advising the repeal or modification of the\\r\\nEnglish compulsory law, which, however, did not apply to adults, but\\r\\nonly to infants under one year, which form the most susceptible part\\r\\nof the population. After this recommendation a law was passed, now in\\r\\nforce, called the “conscientious clause,” whereby parents can exempt\\r\\ntheir children from vaccination by filing a statement of conscientious\\r\\nobjection; and under this law vaccination has so greatly declined in\\r\\nEngland that to-day it is estimated that over sixty per cent. of the\\r\\nchildren born are unvaccinated, and yet, contrary to the contentions of\\r\\nthe vaccinators, smallpox has not increased, but has greatly declined,\\r\\ncorresponding to the decline in vaccination and to the increase in\\r\\ngeneral sanitation and hygiene, as England is now one of the most\\r\\nsanitary countries in the world. This beneficial effect on public\\r\\nhealth resulting from repealing compulsion and making vaccination\\r\\nvoluntary has been so positive that the English Minister of Health,\\r\\nHon. John Burns, made this significant public declaration in the House\\r\\nof Commons on April 12, 1911, viz.: “Just in proportion as, in recent\\r\\nyears, exemptions [from vaccination] have gone up from four per cent.\\r\\nto thirty per cent., so deaths from smallpox have declined.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI will now add a fourth and last example in which I think you will\\r\\nfind a full justification for suppressing all compulsory vaccination\\r\\nas both evil and unnecessary, and this is the advice of one of the\\r\\nlatest English books on “The Vaccination Question” by Dr. Millard,\\r\\nLondon, 1914. Dr. Millard, although a strong pro-vaccinist, has been\\r\\nfor the past ten years the health officer of the unvaccinated city of\\r\\nLeicester, which has a population of about 300,000, and for the last\\r\\nthirty years has relied on sanitation and hygiene without vaccination\\r\\nto protect and improve the public health, and this is the gist of what\\r\\nDr. Millard says of the success of this method:\\r\\n\\r\\n    “The two crucial and outstanding facts which I wish to lay\\r\\n    stress upon, are:\\r\\n\\r\\n    “(_a_) The unexpected and remarkable experience of the town\\r\\n    of Leicester, which for thirty years has abandoned infantile\\r\\n    vaccination, yet has shown an enormous decline in smallpox\\r\\n    mortality.\\r\\n\\r\\n    “(_b_) The fact that, although infantile vaccination is falling\\r\\n    more and more into disuse throughout the whole country, yet\\r\\n    smallpox, contrary to all pro-vaccinist expectation and\\r\\n    prophecy, continues to decline and has almost disappeared.\\r\\n\\r\\n    ... “The striking facts that in Leicester, without infantile\\r\\n    vaccination, the decline has been greater than in most places,\\r\\n    and that throughout the country smallpox has continued to\\r\\n    decrease in spite of the falling off in vaccination, should\\r\\n    surely be sufficient grounds for legitimate doubt.\\r\\n\\r\\n    ... “If it can be shown that ‘sanitation,’ thoroughly carried\\r\\n    out, is alone sufficient for the effective control of smallpox\\r\\n    in this country (as in Leicester), why inflict upon the\\r\\n    community universal vaccination with all its inseparable\\r\\n    drawbacks? Moreover, what justification can there be any longer\\r\\n    for compulsion?\\r\\n\\r\\n    “It cannot be denied that vaccination causes, in the aggregate,\\r\\n    very considerable injury to health, most of it only temporary,\\r\\n    but some permanent.... We must never forget that vaccination\\r\\n    is an evil. Vaccinia is just as much a disease as smallpox,\\r\\n    though a less serious one, and all diseases must be regarded as\\r\\n    evil and to be avoided, if possible. There is not the slightest\\r\\n    evidence that vaccination, apart from its effect in preventing\\r\\n    smallpox, is of the least value or anything but detrimental\\r\\n    to the human race.... During the last decade the deaths from\\r\\n    vaccinia have several times outnumbered those from smallpox,\\r\\n    whilst if we have regard to the amount of ill health caused by\\r\\n    the two diseases (and putting aside for the moment the question\\r\\n    of the alleged effect of vaccination in lessening smallpox) it\\r\\n    looks as if vaccinia were becoming, so far as the community is\\r\\n    concerned, the more serious disease of the two.”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDEATHS FROM VACCINATION GREATER THAN DEATHS FROM SMALLPOX. SHOCKING\\r\\nDENIAL AND CONCEALMENT OF VACCINATION DEATHS BY OUR DEPARTMENTS OF\\r\\nHEALTH AND VITAL STATISTICS\\r\\n\\r\\nIt will be seen from the last quotation that Dr. Millard is one of\\r\\nthose honest doctors who are not afraid to tell the truth about\\r\\nvaccination, its great dangers and frequent fatalities, the evils and\\r\\nbarbarities of compulsion, the superior value of sanitation, and the\\r\\nstinging fact that the inflicted disease, vaccinia, frequently causes\\r\\nmore deaths per year than the natural disease, smallpox! To confirm\\r\\nthese startling facts I will now quote a few figures, during the period\\r\\nto which Dr. Millard refers, from the record of the Registrar General\\r\\nof England which, as you know, is one of the highest statistical\\r\\nauthorities in the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nData from Reports of Registrar General of England showing deaths from\\r\\nvaccination compared with deaths from smallpox:\\r\\n\\r\\n                _Total Deaths_     _Total Deaths_\\r\\n  _Year_         _from Smallpox_   _from Vaccination_\\r\\n\\r\\n  1906               21               29\\r\\n  1907               10               12\\r\\n  1908               12               13\\r\\n\\r\\n  Total Deaths from Smallpox for six years, 1905 to 1910        199\\r\\n  Total Deaths from Vaccination for six years, 1905 to 1910      99\\r\\n  Deaths from Smallpox in said period under 5 years old          26\\r\\n  Deaths from Vaccination in said period under 5 years old       98\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom these remarkable figures we will see that for the six years from\\r\\n1905 to 1910, in England and Wales, the total deaths from vaccination\\r\\nfor all ages were about half the total deaths from smallpox, but that\\r\\nin the same period the total deaths from vaccination, in the child\\r\\nages of five years and under, were nearly _four times_ the deaths from\\r\\nsmallpox in the same age group!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe report of the English Registrar General for the three years, 1911,\\r\\n1912, and 1913, tell a similar story of vaccinal fatality, as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n  Total Deaths from Smallpox for all ages for\\r\\n            three years, 1911 to 1913                               42\\r\\n  Total Deaths from Vaccination for all ages in said three years    31\\r\\n  Deaths from Smallpox in children under 5 years                     8\\r\\n  Deaths from Vaccination in children of same age                   30\\r\\n\\r\\nHere it will be noted that for the three years stated the total deaths\\r\\nfrom vaccination are three-quarters of the total deaths from smallpox,\\r\\nwhereas the deaths from vaccination in children five years old and\\r\\nunder are over three times more than the deaths from smallpox in the\\r\\nsame age group! I have not examined the Reports later than 1913, having\\r\\nconfined myself to the decade to which Dr. Millard refers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis awful record of fatal vaccinations thus speaks very clearly\\r\\nfor itself and forms a strong indictment of the whole barbarous and\\r\\ndangerous system of compulsory vaccination, whether for child or adult,\\r\\nand must condemn the evil practice in every rational mind.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt can be further proved that an equal or greater fatality from\\r\\nvaccination, as compared with the English records, occurs in our own\\r\\ncountry and in our own State of New York, but these fatalities are\\r\\ndenied and concealed in our death certificates and yearly reports by\\r\\nour vaccinating doctors and health officials of city and State, as I\\r\\nhave repeatedly and publicly charged, and have challenged these doctors\\r\\nand officials to deny or disprove this charge if they can, and I now\\r\\nhereby renew this public challenge on this most serious point. See\\r\\nchallenge on page vi.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor further data on this point, see my pamphlets, “The Crime\\r\\nAgainst the School Child,” “Open Your Eyes,” “Serious Warning,” and\\r\\n“Vaccination and Lockjaw.”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGREAT EPIDEMICS OF DEADLY DISEASE, IN ANIMALS AND MANKIND, CAUSED BY\\r\\nVACCINATION\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, not only is vaccination very dangerous to health and life in many\\r\\nindividual cases and frequently causes more deaths every year than\\r\\nsmallpox, particularly in little children, as already clearly proved,\\r\\nbut another shocking fact is that vaccination has been proved to be the\\r\\ncause of several great epidemics of deadly disease among mankind and\\r\\ndomestic animals, and has probably also been the cause of many other\\r\\nserious epidemics whose origin has not yet been proved.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis shocking fact of vaccine epidemics in recent times is readily\\r\\nproved by current medical works, by Government Reports, and by\\r\\nnotorious public facts occurring within the last few years, as I will\\r\\nnow show.\\r\\n\\r\\nI may first refer on this point to one of the strongest pro-vaccination\\r\\nworks now published, viz., “Acute Contagious Diseases,” by Drs. Welch\\r\\nand Schamberg, Lea Brothers & Co., Philadelphia, 1905. On page 65, in\\r\\nthis work, the following serious admission is made:\\r\\n\\r\\n    “Several appalling epidemics of septicemia after vaccination\\r\\n    are on record; one occurred in the United States, one in\\r\\n    Germany, and one in France.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThese epidemics are shown to have caused many deaths in children and\\r\\nadults, the fatal effect being very rapid, the deaths occurring in one\\r\\nor a few days after vaccination.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn page 74, in the same work, this clear admission of an epidemic of\\r\\nthat most awful and fatal disease, lockjaw, caused by vaccination, is\\r\\nmade as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n    “In October, November, and December, 1901, there was a small\\r\\n    epidemic of tetanus after vaccination in Camden, Philadelphia,\\r\\n    and to a certain extent in near-by towns.\\r\\n\\r\\n    “Camden had eleven cases, and Philadelphia even more than this\\r\\n    number.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is to be here noted, however, that, bad as this last admission is,\\r\\nthe pro-vaccinators did not give the public the whole truth in this\\r\\nlast statement, but which I will now add here, viz., that in these\\r\\nepidemics the deaths from the lockjaw infection in the vaccination\\r\\nwounds exceeded by manifold the deaths from smallpox in the same\\r\\ntime and locality! Here is another great proof of the medical and\\r\\nstatistical truth to which I have repeatedly called attention, viz.,\\r\\nthat vaccination is frequently a much more dangerous and fatal disease\\r\\nthan natural smallpox, and, therefore, obviously, for this reason\\r\\nalone, should not be forced on any person against free will and consent.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nVACCINATION BOTH A THEORETICAL AND A PROVED CAUSE OF EPIDEMICS\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a previous letter to the Secretary of War, dated October 14, 1918,\\r\\nand published in the _Washington Herald_ of November 20, 1918, I have\\r\\npointed out the dangerous nature of vaccination, particularly during\\r\\nepidemics, and the hygienic importance of suspending all vaccination\\r\\nduring our recent epidemic of influenza and pneumonia, and the further\\r\\ndesirability of making all vaccination strictly free and voluntary. I\\r\\nalso then called attention to the probability that the repeated and\\r\\nmultiple vaccinations of millions of men, in this country and Europe,\\r\\nwith various septicemic infections for the last two years, may have had\\r\\nsome relation to this epidemic, which seems to have been more severe\\r\\namong the vaccinated men in the military camps and hospitals than among\\r\\nthe rest of the population. And I would now like to repeat here some\\r\\nof the important facts which I have stated in said letter as to both\\r\\nthe probable and the proved relation of vaccination to many deadly\\r\\nepidemics.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGRAVE NATURE OF RECENT EPIDEMIC OF INFLUENZA AND PNEUMONIA, AND\\r\\nPOSSIBLE RELATION OF VACCINATION THERETO\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the rapidity, severity, and mortality of this disease, it would\\r\\nseem not to be a true influenza, as heretofore known, and as its worst\\r\\ncases are characterized by a rapid and fatal ending, with a few days’\\r\\nsickness, in malignant or septic pneumonia, with abscesses in the\\r\\nlungs, it seems more related to the very fatal “_Pneumonic Plague_”\\r\\nwhich raged in Manchuria after the Japanese war. This suspicion is\\r\\nstrengthened by the fact that the chief germ found in the fatal\\r\\ncases is the “streptococcus,” which is found in the worst forms of\\r\\n“blood poisoning” or “septicemia,” and also in vaccination. Now,\\r\\nthe act of ordinary vaccination, as already proved, is, in itself,\\r\\nan act of blood poisoning, pure and simple, and it is so classed in\\r\\nmedical and statistical works as a form of “septicemia,” and one\\r\\ndisease germ commonly found, with many others, in vaccine virus is the\\r\\nstreptococcus, which is the chief germ found in all bad pus infections\\r\\nand abscess formations. Therefore, as the act of vaccination is simply\\r\\nthe impregnation of the body and blood with a pus infection identical\\r\\nwith “septicemia” or “pyæmia,” and as this infecting process has been\\r\\nrepeated at wholesale in the bodies of thousands and tens of thousands\\r\\nof men closely massed in camps, should it be any wonder if an epidemic\\r\\nof some sort of “septicemia” should crop out at some time under such\\r\\nconditions?\\r\\n\\r\\nIn leading medical and statistical works, both influenza and pneumonia\\r\\nand typhoid fever and vaccination are all classed as different forms of\\r\\n“septicemia,” and while I do not, of course, know, and do not say, that\\r\\nthe recent epidemic of influenza and pneumonia was actually caused by\\r\\nvaccination, yet I repeat that when the body and blood of millions of\\r\\nmen all over this country and Europe are deliberately impregnated with\\r\\nvarious septic diseases, or septicemic infections, can any reasonable\\r\\nperson, whether doctor or layman, be surprised if such world-wide,\\r\\nand million times repeated, acts of septicemic infection should be\\r\\nultimately proved to have some causative or conditional relation to the\\r\\nrecent world-wide epidemic of septicemic disease? Is it physically or\\r\\nmedically possible to go on sowing and spreading some known and unknown\\r\\nseptic diseases at wholesale, within human bodies, without reaping\\r\\nsome big harvest of deadly septic diseases as a necessary consequence?\\r\\nIn the words of Scripture, can we keep on “sowing” the “winds” of\\r\\ninfection without ultimately “reaping” the “whirlwind” of epidemics?\\r\\n\\r\\nIt has been suggested that this epidemic originated in the\\r\\nmulti-vaccinated and diseased or impoverished German army and has\\r\\ntraveled one-quarter round the earth from that focus of infection.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt has also been suggested that this epidemic originated from a\\r\\nregiment of coolies or native Hindoo troops brought from India to\\r\\nFrance who were infected with a severe disease like Pneumonic Plague,\\r\\nand from them this disease spread to the other soldiers in camp and\\r\\nfield and thence over the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt has been further suggested that this disease should not be called a\\r\\ntrue influenza or pneumonia at all, but is essentially a most virulent\\r\\nform of general septicemia, and that it originated from the frightfully\\r\\ninfected soil of the battle-fields, which, in addition to the ordinary\\r\\ndeadly soil infections, contains virulent septicemic and cadaveric\\r\\ninfections from the great mass of buried and unburied bodies. And as\\r\\nthe soldiers in camp and field were already impregnated with several\\r\\nsepticemic infections in the multiple vaccinations of five or six kinds\\r\\nto which they have been almost universally subjected, their systems\\r\\nthus became “sensitized” or highly susceptible to further infection,\\r\\nparticularly to what was evidently a new and very severe type of soil\\r\\nand cadaveric infection. This theory seems to fit the present known\\r\\nfacts and would explain the probable origin of this very severe type of\\r\\nvirulent septicemic plague, which shows itself in this mysterious and\\r\\ndeadly epidemic with its mortality of thirty to sixty per cent., which\\r\\nwe have been improperly regarding as ordinary influenza and pneumonia.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn my letter to the Secretary of War I proved that there was a distinct\\r\\nmedical and logical relation between influenza and vaccination, and\\r\\nthat many serious diseases, including smallpox and cowpox, commence\\r\\nlike influenza and may be mistaken for it,[2] but I do not need to go\\r\\ninto proof of that point here, but can now say that this point further\\r\\nstrengthens the suspicions stated that the recent epidemic of influenza\\r\\nand septicemia or septic pneumonia may have had some causative relation\\r\\nto the extensive wholesale and repeated vaccinations in the military\\r\\ncamps throughout the world, and would indicate, according to another\\r\\ntheory, that this vaccine infection had escaped from and overflowed its\\r\\nusual bounds and was running wild as a world-wide epidemic infection;\\r\\nand hence the positive and compelling reasons for checking this\\r\\noverflowing infection by suspending all vaccination while this epidemic\\r\\nand infecting condition exists, and making all vaccination voluntary\\r\\ninstead of compulsory as heretofore.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEPIDEMICS ACTUALLY CAUSED BY VACCINATION\\r\\n\\r\\nThat the hypothetical condition suggested in the preceding paragraph,\\r\\nviz., that the wholesale and world-wide vaccine infection going on\\r\\nfor the past few years had possibly escaped from its usual bounds and\\r\\nhas been overflowing and running wild and thus causing epidemics in\\r\\nmankind, or animals,--that this, I say, may be no mere hypothesis or\\r\\ntheory, but rather a hard fact, is proved by the frightful epidemics of\\r\\n“foot and mouth disease” in the United States in 1902, 1908, and 1914,\\r\\nsome of which originated from two of the largest vaccine factories in\\r\\nthis country, one in Philadelphia and the other in Detroit, and were\\r\\nwidely distributed to cattle and mankind in several of our States. See\\r\\nreports of U. S. Bureau of Animal Industry, 1902 and 1908. Also Year\\r\\nBook of U. S. Department of Agriculture, 1914, page 20. See also page\\r\\n96 in Supplement.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is clearly shown in these reports that vaccine infection was the\\r\\ndirect cause of these epidemics in 1902 and 1908; but the cause of the\\r\\nepidemic of 1914 and 1915 is not so clearly proven, although there\\r\\nis a strong suspicion that it was caused by vaccine infection, like\\r\\nthe two others, and, as a matter of fact, it originated in the same\\r\\nState--Michigan--where the epidemic of 1908 originated and where one of\\r\\nthe largest vaccine factories in the country is located. See page 98 in\\r\\nSupplement.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese vaccine epidemics caused the destruction of hundreds of thousands\\r\\nof cattle and other domestic animals in over a score of States, at a\\r\\nloss of many millions of dollars to the Government and people of this\\r\\ncountry. See page 102. Surely, Mr. President, any medical operation\\r\\nso inherently dangerous and capable of inflicting such injury on\\r\\nanimals or man should not be forced on any person against conscientious\\r\\nobjection or without free will and consent and should not be required\\r\\nby our enlightened democratic Government in our Army or Navy in any\\r\\nform except purely voluntary, like all other medical remedies and\\r\\noperations.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is an attempt made in some of the official reports to deny that\\r\\nthese epidemics of “foot and mouth disease” caused by vaccination could\\r\\nbe or were transmitted to mankind in virus and were limited to domestic\\r\\nanimals, but this I believe to be a grave mistake, as I have the most\\r\\nconvincing evidence that this disease was so transmitted to many human\\r\\nvictims, both child and adult, with most awful effects in 1902 and\\r\\n1908, and is frequently transmitted to mankind in vaccine virus. See\\r\\nSupplement, page 111.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nVACCINE FACTORIES A POSSIBLE AND PROVED SOURCE OF EPIDEMICS AND SHOULD\\r\\nBE INVESTIGATED BY CONGRESS AND THE GOVERNMENT\\r\\n\\r\\nThis foot and mouth disease is a horrible eruptive fever, a kind of\\r\\n“cowpox,” or something like a mongrel smallpox and diphtheria combined,\\r\\nor also like a very bad chickenpox, with successive crops of vesicles,\\r\\nblisters or blotches, something like cold sores, large and small,\\r\\nbreaking out all over the body, but chiefly on the hoofs, or hands and\\r\\nfeet, lips and nostrils, also inside the mouth and throat as is common\\r\\nin smallpox. Sometimes these blotches become confluent and pustular and\\r\\ncontinue for months, but, usually, the eruption ends in a few weeks\\r\\nin recovery or death. In the worst cases, with internal eruptions and\\r\\npus infection, affecting vital nerve centers, the end comes in a few\\r\\ndays by the victim choking to death from paralysis of the heart and\\r\\nbreathing organs like what happens in infant paralysis, rabies and\\r\\nlockjaw. For effects on cattle and mankind, see Figs. 7, 8, 9, 11, 12\\r\\nand 13 in Supplement.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow here we see that at least two and probably three great epidemics\\r\\nof fatal disease have originated from vaccine factories and this\\r\\nraises the serious question as to how far other epidemics, or even the\\r\\nrecent epidemic of influenza, and pneumonia, may have originated from\\r\\nsome vaccine factory or from some of their products extensively or\\r\\ncarelessly used. Surely the places where dangerous infectious diseases\\r\\nare constantly propagated on a gigantic scale, and disseminated\\r\\ntherefrom into the bodies of millions of animals and mankind, should be\\r\\nthe very possible or probable source of epidemic disease. Obviously,\\r\\ntherefore, this entire subject of the present extensive _manufacture\\r\\nand distribution of diseases_ or _disease cultures_ or _products_\\r\\nand its relation to epidemics and public health should be thoroughly\\r\\ninvestigated by Congress and the Government at an early date. To\\r\\nshow you what a gigantic and dangerous medical interest this vaccine\\r\\nmanufacture has become, it may be sufficient to state that there are\\r\\nnow about 100 concerns licensed by the U. S. Government to manufacture\\r\\nvaccines and serums for _animal and human uses_. This is one of the\\r\\ngreat medical interests supporting compulsory vaccination, which is a\\r\\ngrave medical malpractice, and should be abolished wherever it exists\\r\\nand replaced by wholly voluntary vaccination as already shown.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEPIDEMICS AND HIGH DEATH RATES IN THE ARMY PROBABLY CAUSED BY WHOLESALE\\r\\nAND REPEATED VACCINATIONS. DEATH RATE OF ARMY FROM DISEASE MUCH GREATER\\r\\nTHAN THAT OF CIVIL POPULATION\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter careful study of this subject for years I firmly believe that,\\r\\nwith the excellent sanitary and hygienic conditions now used in our\\r\\nArmy, the dangerous system of disease inoculations, whereby the blood\\r\\nof every man is impregnated with multiple and repeated vaccinations\\r\\nof several diseases, such as smallpox, typhoid, paratyphoid, etc., is\\r\\na system, to say the least, that is neither necessary nor ultimately\\r\\nuseful for army health. And it is probable that this system produces\\r\\nfar more disease than it prevents. For example: For one death which\\r\\nnaturally occurs in the whole population from smallpox or typhoid\\r\\nfever, ten to one hundred deaths occur from the far more frequent and\\r\\nfatal diseases of tuberculosis, measles, pneumonia and meningitis. And\\r\\nlet us here ask, what is the use of having soldiers forced to submit\\r\\nto a whole series of disease infections, if these infections, at best,\\r\\ngive immunity only for a little while from such diseases as smallpox\\r\\nand typhoid and make the system more susceptible to the far worse\\r\\ndiseases of measles, pneumonia and meningitis, which actually seems to\\r\\nbe the possible effects of vaccination from the recurring epidemics of\\r\\nthese dangerous diseases in our heavily vaccinated camps?\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a matter of fact, my studies of deaths from vaccination for many\\r\\nyears past show that meningitis and pneumonia are some of the most\\r\\nfrequent complications; and these two diseases seem to have a certain\\r\\nrelation to vaccination and seem to be very fatal where vaccination\\r\\nprecedes them, and thus acts in what is called a “double” or “mixed\\r\\ninfection,” which is known to be very dangerous to health and life.\\r\\nSee Osler’s “Modern Medicine,” 1913, Vol. I, pages 32 and 33. See also\\r\\nOsler’s “Principles and Practice of Medicine,” 8th edition, 1918, page\\r\\n330, on the “Influence of Vaccination on Other Diseases.” See also\\r\\npages 135 and 139 in the Supplement.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother most significant fact in this connection is the high death-rate\\r\\nfrom disease in the Army, as compared with the civil population, which\\r\\nI will now consider.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn page 18 in the Report of the Secretary of War for 1918 the death\\r\\nrate of the Army in the United States from disease for the year ending\\r\\nAugust 30, 1918, is given as 6.4; that is, about 6½ deaths for every\\r\\nthousand men in the Army. The age-groups composing the Army are, of\\r\\ncourse, on the general average, between twenty and forty, inclusive. In\\r\\nthe same Report it is admitted that the male civilian death-rate for\\r\\nthe same ages as in the Army (twenty to forty) was about 4.7, which\\r\\nis a difference of 1.7 or nearly 2 per 1000 in favor of the civil\\r\\npopulation or civilian males! This civil death-rate is thus, actually\\r\\nand relatively, much lower than the army death-rate, and this fact is\\r\\nvery significant as positively indicating some serious cause at work to\\r\\nlower greatly the vitality and resistance and increase the death-rate\\r\\nin the army! Now what is that cause?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe figures 6.4 per thousand for the Army and 4.7 per thousand for the\\r\\ncivil population of the same ages is a great _actual_ difference, but,\\r\\nof course, means, _relatively_, a much greater total difference against\\r\\nthe Army because the army population is made up of “hand-picked”\\r\\nmen selected for their nearly perfect health and physique and the\\r\\nabsence of all serious constitutional diseases such as tuberculosis\\r\\nand others, which are all excluded from the army group. On the other\\r\\nhand, the civil population of the same age group of twenty to forty\\r\\nincludes the healthy and diseased, and particularly those afflicted\\r\\nwith tuberculosis, which constitute a big fraction, and which disease\\r\\nis most prevalent and fatal in this very age group of twenty to forty!\\r\\nYet this civil population, containing all the diseased at the most\\r\\nfatal adult ages, has a much lower death-rate than the “hand-picked”\\r\\nphysically perfect army group! Now what is the cause of this much\\r\\nhigher death-rate in men of the most physically perfect class, and who\\r\\nare now treated with the best sanitary and hygienic living conditions,\\r\\nand where the death-rate should be the lowest? What is the cause of\\r\\nthis difference if it is not that extraordinary medical practice,\\r\\nor malpractice, which deliberately impregnates the bodies of these\\r\\nexceptionally healthy and “hand-picked” men with a whole series of the\\r\\nworst type of disease infections known--that is, septicemic infections,\\r\\nlike the typhoids and the variolas, etc.? And should anyone wonder,\\r\\ntherefore, if the death lists of the army should show plainly in the\\r\\nblood poisoning diseases of pneumonia, meningitis, etc., which are\\r\\nknown to follow frequently after vaccination? See pages 139 to 142\\r\\nfor a convincing proof of this point. Surely no person of ordinary\\r\\nsense--not even an extreme vaccinator--can presume to seriously tell\\r\\nus that impregnating the human body and blood with several disease\\r\\ncultures and infections is a purely healthy practice _per se_. And\\r\\nsurely no person of ordinary sense can come to any other conclusion\\r\\nexcept this: that such operations must be dangerous and unhealthy _per\\r\\nse_.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn all this contention, Mr. President, there is, surely, something\\r\\nwhich is very important, which should be most carefully considered\\r\\nand fully investigated by the Commander-in-Chief, by Congress and the\\r\\nDepartments, at an early day.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWONDERFUL WORK OF THE WAR AND NAVY DEPARTMENTS GRATEFULLY ACKNOWLEDGED\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore closing I must here express to you, as Commander-in-Chief,\\r\\nmy full appreciation of the wonderful work done by the War and Navy\\r\\nDepartments and by the officers of the Army and Navy in raising,\\r\\nencamping, training and equipping our great Army and Navy and putting\\r\\nthem into the fighting field so quickly and so potently, with the\\r\\nresult of immediately turning the tide of warfare against the brutal\\r\\nenemy, for which majestic result these Departments, and the officers of\\r\\nthe Army and Navy, most fully deserve, as they undoubtedly have, the\\r\\nunstinted thanks and congratulations of our whole citizenry, civil and\\r\\nmilitary, man and woman.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo army or navy in field, camp or ship has ever been taken better\\r\\ncare of in a general sanitary, hygienic and medical sense than our\\r\\nArmy and Navy in this gruelling war. The able and liberal way in\\r\\nwhich the physical, moral, mental, religious and recreational needs\\r\\nof the men have been covered by various bodies, military, medical,\\r\\ncivic, and religious, has been the wonder of all our citizens who\\r\\nhave visited our camps. And to this was undoubtedly due the cheerful\\r\\nand high spirits, the wonderful morale and fighting power which\\r\\nmade themselves instantly felt on the battle-fields of Europe and\\r\\nso quickly brought the barbarous enemy to his knees in the glorious\\r\\nclimax of Victory and Peace which we are now enjoying, and which we\\r\\nall firmly hope and believe will soon be followed by a Permanent and\\r\\nInternational Peace coextensive with the civilized world, for which\\r\\ngreat end, Mr. President, you have been working so ably, energetically\\r\\nand devotedly. And I feel sure that your master efforts with our own\\r\\npeople and with our victorious Allies will soon bring about that League\\r\\nof Nations for the government of the world based on the eternal\\r\\nprinciples of reciprocal right and justice and the basic principles of\\r\\nAmerican Institutions--Equality, Consent of the Governed, and Rational\\r\\nLiberty--for all persons in their inherent natural rights.\\r\\n\\r\\nI, therefore, regret that I have had any criticism to make on this\\r\\nglorious record of our Army and Navy, but this criticism really\\r\\nconcerns only a part of the medical profession in the Army and Navy,\\r\\nand one of its medical dogmas, and does not reflect on the rank and\\r\\nfile of the military and naval forces of our country, a majority of\\r\\nwhich does not, I believe, approve this dangerous medical practice, or\\r\\nmalpractice, of compulsory vaccination which has been forced by medical\\r\\ndogmatism on the Army and Navy, and which, I believe, clearly violates\\r\\nfundamental American principles and also stultifies our proud claim\\r\\nthat this is a government of “Liberty and Justice for all.”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCOMPULSORY VACCINATION CONDEMNED AS UN-AMERICAN\\r\\n\\r\\nIn compulsory vaccination there is obviously neither “liberty” nor\\r\\n“justice” and it is utterly opposed to the fundamental American\\r\\nprinciple of inherent human right to medical liberty and choice, and to\\r\\nsanctity of body, and it therefore fits properly only with some code of\\r\\nPrussianism--from which it has been in fact copied.\\r\\n\\r\\nI would, therefore, now like to show by appeal to our great basic\\r\\nAmerican Documents of Rights and Liberties that all forms of medical\\r\\ncompulsion and dictation and compulsory vaccination are illegal and\\r\\nunconstitutional and also violate all true civic and medical ethics.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE, OUR BASIC CHARTER OF AMERICAN RIGHTS,\\r\\nCONDEMNS ALL VIOLATIONS OF INHERENT NATURAL RIGHTS\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Declaration of Independence is, I believe, the greatest ethical\\r\\nand political document ever penned by human hand or human wisdom--the\\r\\ngreatest document of Human Rights and Liberties, Basic Ethics, Civic\\r\\nReligion and Democratic Government ever written--and all expressed in\\r\\nits one essential paragraph, as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n    “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are\\r\\n    created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with\\r\\n    certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty\\r\\n    and the pursuit of Happiness. That to secure these rights,\\r\\n    Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just\\r\\n    powers from the consent of the governed,--That whenever any\\r\\n    Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the\\r\\n    Right of the People to alter or to abolish it.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have been accustomed to call this great document a “Declaration of\\r\\nIndependence,” but it should more properly be called a “Declaration\\r\\nof Rights” because “Independence,” or self-government, is only one of\\r\\nthe several “unalienable” rights declared in this great charter. It\\r\\nis in fact our great “Bill of Rights,” being our first Charter and\\r\\nDeclaration of those essential, natural, inherent and ineffaceable\\r\\nrights of mankind, which all governments must respect, defend and\\r\\nenforce, and which cannot be ignored or invaded by any authority,\\r\\norganization or government whatever. It is indeed our American “Magna\\r\\nCharta” of fundamental rights and our first or _Pre-Constitution_\\r\\npreceding our formal Constitution, and, of course, equal to it as a\\r\\nbasis for all law and government, and particularly expressing what\\r\\nmay be termed our _Pre-Constitutional Rights_--that is, those rights\\r\\nwhich always existed by “Natural” and “Divine” endowment before any\\r\\nhuman laws, charters or constitutions were ever written; and it, of\\r\\ncourse, antedates, and therefore takes precedence even over our State\\r\\nand National laws and Constitutions, which, to be valid, must be\\r\\nbased on the _fundamental_ principles of _inherent human and natural\\r\\nrights_ which are _naturally and divinely_ and equally conferred upon\\r\\nall mankind. It must be remembered at this point that the official\\r\\ntitle of this great document is “The Unanimous Declaration of the\\r\\nThirteen United States of America,” which shows that it is the official\\r\\nstatement or code of the foundation governing principles of the New\\r\\nNation issued by its first Congress and has, therefore, the full effect\\r\\nof a “Constitution,” “Pre-Constitution” or “Bill of Rights.”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE CODE AND BASIS OF AMERICANISM\\r\\n\\r\\nThis great primary Code of Rights, which is adapted for the just\\r\\nand beneficent rule of mankind in all their relations, has not been\\r\\nhalf well enough understood or appreciated by our American people\\r\\nheretofore, and it has been usually looked upon as chiefly a political\\r\\ndocument, whereas, it is essentially much more than that, being in\\r\\nfact a great code of basic ethics and civic religion, in addition to a\\r\\ncode of democratic government, with a wide scope and character, which\\r\\nfits it equally to individual, national, or international relations;\\r\\nand this makes it truly our American Bible and Creed and our basis for\\r\\na great American and Universal “Religion” both ethical and political,\\r\\nwhich can and should be now adopted by the “League of Nations” as\\r\\na standard code or basis for the moral and political government of\\r\\nmankind the world over, and should be taught in all our schools as the\\r\\nbasis of Americanism.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is time, therefore, that Americans clearly understood and\\r\\nappreciated the full ethical, legal and political scope and sense of\\r\\nthis wonderful code of one paragraph, and it is time also that this\\r\\ngreat and simple _Code of Essential Americanism_ was plainly emblazoned\\r\\non our public walls, spaces and monuments like the inscription\\r\\n“Holiness to the Lord” displayed on the forefront of the high priests,\\r\\nas directed in Exodus, Chapter 28, so that all our people can get fully\\r\\nacquainted and inspired with the broad and simple principles of Right\\r\\nand Justice in this sublime Code of Americanism.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis great paragraph of basic Americanism should, therefore, be\\r\\nconspicuously posted on every public building, school, and church in\\r\\nthe land, over the Judge’s bench in every Court, over the rostrum\\r\\nin every Legislature and over the desk of every public officer, and\\r\\nparticularly over the desk of every public doctor, Medical Board and\\r\\nBoard of Health in the land, which have been heretofore some of the\\r\\nworst violators of this code of unalienable human rights in their\\r\\nvarious barbarous practices of medical domination, dictation and\\r\\ncompulsion, and forced infliction of disease.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow I do not intend, in this article, to show just how the Declaration\\r\\nof Independence can be seriously considered as a clear and sure\\r\\nbasis for rational ethics and civic religion for the legal and moral\\r\\ngovernment of mankind, in all relations, having reserved that important\\r\\nsubject for full treatment in a separate article, but I do intend to\\r\\nshow here how the evil of compulsory vaccination and all other forms\\r\\nof compulsory medicine are gross violations of the Declaration and its\\r\\nprinciples of basic Americanism and inherent human rights so clearly\\r\\ndefined therein.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE FIVE ARTICLES OF THE DECLARATION OF RIGHTS, JULY 4, 1776\\r\\n\\r\\n    FIRST: All men are created equal.\\r\\n\\r\\n    SECOND: All men are endowed by their Creator with certain\\r\\n    unalienable rights, among which are life, liberty, and the\\r\\n    pursuit of happiness.\\r\\n\\r\\n    THIRD: Governments are instituted among men to secure these\\r\\n    unalienable rights.\\r\\n\\r\\n    FOURTH: Governments derive their just powers from the consent\\r\\n    of the governed.\\r\\n\\r\\n    FIFTH: Whenever any form of government becomes destructive\\r\\n    of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or to\\r\\n    abolish it.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet us now take up the first article of the Declaration--“_All men are\\r\\ncreated equal_”--and see what it means, and what it does not mean.\\r\\nIt surely does not mean that all men are created equal in worldly\\r\\npossessions or natural advantages, in physical strength, personal\\r\\nbeauty, moral sense or mental power, as it is notorious that mankind\\r\\ndiffer unavoidably and universally in all these conditions. But it\\r\\nclearly does mean that all men are created equal in a moral, legal and\\r\\ngovernmental sense, equal as members of society or citizens of the\\r\\nState, no matter how much they may differ in inherent or acquired\\r\\nadvantages. It means that one man shall count no more than any other\\r\\nman before the law or in the State by reason of worldly possessions or\\r\\npersonal advantages, but that each man shall count alike and equal, no\\r\\nmatter how rich or poor, strong or weak, smart or dull, handsome or\\r\\nplain he may be. It means also that the “Creator” has not arbitrarily\\r\\npicked out any particular person, group, family, or race, as His\\r\\nspecial favorites, to rule or lord it over any other person or mass\\r\\nof persons; and, particularly, that the Creator has not specially\\r\\n“ordained” any favorite person to rule over any part of mankind without\\r\\ntheir selection and consent. It does mean that the Creator has no\\r\\n“favorites,” but that all men are “equal” before Him, and, hence,\\r\\nthat barbarous and oppressive fallacy of “Divine-Right-Monarchism”\\r\\nis emphatically repudiated in this first Article. It means that all\\r\\n“one-man-rule” or “one-race-rule,” and all vile Germanism of the\\r\\n“Gott-Mit-Uns” or “Germans-Over-All” type, is flatly condemned. But,\\r\\nper contra, this Article does plainly mean that the Creator has\\r\\ndivinely ordained each and every human individual to be an equal\\r\\n“sovereign” in his own right and that all government depends on the\\r\\nselection and consent of these individual and equal sovereigns who are\\r\\n“endowed” with the “divine right” of collectively forming their own\\r\\ngovernment and selecting their own rulers, instead of having a rule and\\r\\na ruler forced on them by alleged “divine” command, and without their\\r\\nselection or consent. In other words, this Article obviously means,\\r\\npure and simple, “_government of the people, by the people, for the\\r\\npeople_.”\\r\\n\\r\\nNow if each individual American is divinely ordained as an equalized\\r\\nsovereign in his own right--and this is surely a grand distinction of\\r\\nthe American Institution and the American citizen--he obviously has\\r\\na sovereign right to his own body and all his natural possessions;\\r\\nand the most sacred and essential of these rights and possessions is,\\r\\nobviously, the right to his own physical body, the sanctity of his own\\r\\nperson, and the right to decide how it shall be treated or taken care\\r\\nof in health or disease; and if he has not this sacred and sovereign\\r\\nright to his own body he has practically no right at all and might\\r\\nas well be wiped out and would be better dead. Therefore, if any\\r\\ndoctor or other person claims the right to possess the body of any\\r\\nman, to experiment or operate upon it, to medicate, cut, inoculate, or\\r\\ntreat his body as he might see fit, without the free choice, consent\\r\\nor approval of that man, it is obvious that the man is no longer a\\r\\nsovereign or the owner of his own body, but is a mere “slave” or\\r\\ndomestic animal and that the doctor really owns his body and is his\\r\\n“master” as much as if he were a pig or dog; so that, therefore, all\\r\\n“equality” and “sovereignty” of the individual is destroyed by this\\r\\nmedical “hoggery” and we have not a “_government of the people, by\\r\\nthe people, for the people_,” but a government of the doctors, by\\r\\nthe doctors, for the doctors,--which in fact we now have to a very\\r\\ndangerous extent. And, indeed, medical organization, compulsion,\\r\\ndictation and domination have now got to such a stage that it is one of\\r\\nthe most dangerous powers in our body politic and must be curbed, as I\\r\\nwill show later on.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt therefore follows that all compulsory or dictatorial medicine is\\r\\nan absolute violation of the first or basic principle of Americanism\\r\\nas expressed in our great Declaration of Rights, and our first or\\r\\nPre-Constitution, and therefore must be abolished if we would be true\\r\\nto basic human right and fundamental American principles.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe will now take up the second Article of the Declaration and study its\\r\\nmeaning. This Article, with a slight variation of the official words,\\r\\nis as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n    “All men are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable\\r\\n    rights, among which are life, liberty, and the pursuit of\\r\\n    happiness.”\\r\\n\\r\\nNow the great keynote-words in this clause, “_unalienable rights_,”\\r\\nmean “inseparable rights,” rights which the citizen cannot be separated\\r\\nfrom, rights which cannot be removed or taken away from the people or\\r\\ndenied or invaded by any government or power whatever, but which all\\r\\ngovernments must respect and defend.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis second article from the Declaration of Rights is, I think, the\\r\\nwisest, most important and significant statement in a political, legal\\r\\nand moral sense that was ever written by human hand or human mind,\\r\\nbecause it is the essence of the essential paragraph of the Declaration\\r\\nand clearly expresses the basis of Democratic Government, Rational\\r\\nEthics, and Civic Religion, in one simple clause or sentence! This\\r\\nbasis is simply the inherent and “unalienable” rights of our fellow men\\r\\nnecessary for human life, liberty and happiness, which are naturally\\r\\nor divinely conferred upon all men, equally, and cannot be ignored or\\r\\nviolated by individuals or governments. And it is obvious that the\\r\\nhonest and general recognition of these rights will at once establish\\r\\ntrue justice and righteousness among men and nations, and the disregard\\r\\nand violation of these rights is now, and ever has been, the cause of\\r\\nall wrongdoing, war, and other evils between men and nations the world\\r\\nover.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis simple and potent statement of basic human rights is therefore\\r\\nequal in ethical and legal force to the bulk of the Decalogue itself\\r\\nand to the Golden Rule of Humanity, Honesty and Justice in its three\\r\\nbest versions from the world’s greatest moral teachers, Confucius,\\r\\nPlato and Christ; so that in this simple sentence from the essential\\r\\nparagraph of our first great national document we have a code of\\r\\nDemocratic Government and of Human Ethics in one sentence, which, as\\r\\nbefore suggested, should be taught in all our schools as the basis of\\r\\nAmericanism.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE GOLDEN RULE AND THE DECLARATION OF RIGHTS COMPARED\\r\\n\\r\\nIt may be worth while to consider here for a moment what is perhaps\\r\\nthe best version of the “Golden Rule,” viz., the version of Plato in\\r\\nPlato’s Laws, Book XI, Prof. Jowett’s translation, which is in these\\r\\nwords, dated about 360 B.C.:\\r\\n\\r\\n    “Thou shalt not touch that which is mine, if thou canst help,\\r\\n    or remove the least thing which belongs to me without my\\r\\n    consent: and may I, being of sound mind, do to others as I\\r\\n    would that they should do to me.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is surely a most righteous ethical code, clear, broad\\r\\nand simple, and in moral and logical effect it is nearer like our\\r\\nAmerican Declaration of Rights than any other formula, particularly as\\r\\nregards the recognition of the sacred personal rights of the individual\\r\\nwhich is equivalent to the principle of “unalienable rights” in the\\r\\nDeclaration. The phrase, “Thou shalt not touch that which is mine or\\r\\nremove the least thing which belongs to me without my consent,” is\\r\\ncertainly a most righteous rule of human honesty, sanctity, justice\\r\\nand security which surely condemns everything like compulsory medicine\\r\\nwhich touches and violates the body with inflicted disease, without\\r\\nconsent of the patient, and removes and destroys the most sacred\\r\\npossession of the individual, viz., bodily sanctity, health and life.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nUNALIENABLE RIGHTS ANALYZED AND DEFINED\\r\\n\\r\\nIt will be noted that the significant words of the second article of\\r\\nthe Declaration state that “all men” are endowed by their Creator with\\r\\n_“certain” “unalienable rights,” among which are “life,” “liberty”\\r\\nand the “pursuit of happiness.”_ By the word “certain” is, therefore,\\r\\nclearly meant _various_, _many_ or _several_ rights, most of which are\\r\\nleft unspecified or not categorically stated except where it refers\\r\\nto the chief or general rights of “life, liberty and the pursuit of\\r\\nhappiness.” And it is obvious that by these expressions are clearly\\r\\nmeant all essential natural or “unalienable” rights which are necessary\\r\\nto life, safety, liberty and happiness of the individual and which do\\r\\nnot interfere with, invade or endanger the life, liberty or happiness\\r\\nof any other individual. The right to “life” of course stands first,\\r\\nand is stated first, because without life we have nothing; and the\\r\\nright to “liberty” is stated second, because without reasonable liberty\\r\\nlife itself would be useless, and without ample liberty to pursue our\\r\\nideas of happiness in our own ways, without infringing on the liberty\\r\\nor happiness of others, the right to nominal liberty might itself be\\r\\nuseless and meaningless.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet me now remind you, Mr. President, at this point, that all the\\r\\nreform we ask for in this whole matter is the very important and\\r\\nessential right of Medical Freedom, viz., the free right of every\\r\\nperson to accept or reject any medical operation whatever as the\\r\\ncitizen or patient sees fit, which is obviously an “unalienable right,”\\r\\nand, as I will soon show, is as clearly covered in the Constitution\\r\\nby direct implication as the right to religious freedom is covered by\\r\\nspecific guarantee. And of the two it is obvious that the right to\\r\\nmedical freedom is even more important than the right to religious\\r\\nfreedom, and that medical compulsion is to-day a far more dangerous\\r\\nevil than religious compulsion ever was.\\r\\n\\r\\nMedical compulsion is therefore not only immoral, illegal and\\r\\nunconstitutional, but is also contrary to all true medical ethics,\\r\\nwhich call for the absolute medical freedom and right of the patient to\\r\\ndecide what operation is or is not to be performed on his own body and\\r\\nblood; and, if any doctor, or any government behind the doctor, has any\\r\\nsovereign right whatever to force any medication or operation on any\\r\\npatient, however humble, against his will, consent or desire, will some\\r\\none please tell us where the doctor, or the government, got this right\\r\\nmorally, medically or legally?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nALL POWER COMES FROM THE PEOPLE TO THE GOVERNMENT--NOT VICE VERSA\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery true American and Democrat knows, that according to our immortal\\r\\nDeclaration of Rights and our great Constitution our Government has\\r\\nno rights or powers whatever except what the People have given to it\\r\\nand that the source of all power is in the People and comes _from the\\r\\nPeople to the Government_, and not vice versa, as in the Monarchic\\r\\nsystems which we have been fighting in the Great War. Under our\\r\\ndemocratic system, government does not give any rights to the people,\\r\\nas in monarchic systems, but the people are endowed originally and\\r\\ninherently with all necessary or unalienable rights for life, liberty\\r\\nand happiness, and their government exists simply or chiefly for the\\r\\npurpose of protecting and enforcing these rights, not for granting or\\r\\ndenying rights which exist unalienably in the people themselves.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt will therefore be found that our wonderful Constitution, as well as\\r\\nthe Declaration, covers these fundamental points most distinctly as\\r\\nto inherent, unalienable rights _retained by_ and _dwelling_ in the\\r\\npeople, where it states in Articles IX and X as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n    “The enumeration in the constitution of certain rights, shall\\r\\n    not be construed to deny or disparage others _retained by the\\r\\n    people_.”\\r\\n\\r\\n    “The powers not delegated to the United States by the\\r\\n    Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are\\r\\n    _reserved_ to the States respectively, or _to the people_.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHere we plainly see that the Constitution, as well as the\\r\\nDeclaration which preceded it, show that the People have a whole series\\r\\nof “certain” “unalienable” “reserved” and “retained” rights, and that\\r\\nthese several rights, both specified and unspecified, are divinely\\r\\nconferred and naturally inherent and cannot be invaded or taken away\\r\\nby any government, but must be respected, defended and enforced by\\r\\nall governments, and that governments exist for the chief purpose of\\r\\ndefending and enforcing these rights.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow we might ask just here: Where and when have the People ever given\\r\\nup their most sacred, obvious and essential right to their choice of\\r\\nmedical treatment and to the freedom and sanctity of their own bodies\\r\\nand abandoned their bodies to the doctors to seize when they see fit to\\r\\ninject with disease as in vaccination, to experiment on as they might\\r\\nwish or to operate or medicate as they might choose, without any regard\\r\\nto the free will, consent or desire of the patient?\\r\\n\\r\\nAs government therefore derives its “just powers” only from the\\r\\n“consent of the governed,” so it is obvious that doctors can derive\\r\\ntheir “just powers” to operate only from the _consent of the patient_;\\r\\nand surely the unanswerable question in the preceding paragraph shows\\r\\nclearly the utter barbarity and illegality of all medical compulsion\\r\\nnot only in a basic moral, constitutional and legal sense but also from\\r\\nthe basis of true medical ethics, which surely no true medical doctor\\r\\ncan attempt to deny for one moment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMEDICAL FREEDOM AN UNALIENABLE RIGHT\\r\\n\\r\\nIn conclusion, it therefore follows that the right to Medical Freedom\\r\\nis the clearest and most essential of the “unalienable” “retained” and\\r\\n“reserved” rights possessed by the People under the Declaration and\\r\\nthe Constitution; and as these rights cannot be legally invaded or\\r\\ndenied by any Government, it follows, therefore, that all compulsory\\r\\nvaccination is clearly un-American, illegal, unconstitutional, and\\r\\nmedically barbarous and unworthy of a place on any American, military,\\r\\nmedical, or legislative Code, and should be absolutely abolished as fit\\r\\nonly for some Code of Prussianism--from which, as before said, it has\\r\\nbeen, in fact, copied.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCOMPULSORY VACCINATION CONDEMNED BY OUR COURTS AS UNCONSTITUTIONAL\\r\\n\\r\\nIn illustration of the principles stated in preceding paragraphs, I\\r\\nmight here cite a few decisions from our higher courts showing the\\r\\noutrageous illegal and unconstitutional nature of all forcible or\\r\\ncompulsory vaccination.\\r\\n\\r\\nJudge Bartlett, of the New York Supreme Court, in the case of Walters\\r\\nin 1894, decided that:\\r\\n\\r\\n    “To vaccinate a person against his will, without legal\\r\\n    authority so to do, would be an assault.”\\r\\n\\r\\nJudge Gaynor, of the same Court, in the case of Smith against Health\\r\\nCommissioner Emery of Brooklyn in 1894, gave the following important\\r\\ndecision which was afterwards fully sustained by the New York Court of\\r\\nAppeals:\\r\\n\\r\\n    “If the Commissioner [of Health] had the power to imprison an\\r\\n    individual for refusing to submit to vaccination, I see no\\r\\n    reason why he should not also imprison one for refusing to\\r\\n    swallow a dose. But the Legislature has conferred no such power\\r\\n    upon him, if, indeed, it has the power to do the like.... If\\r\\n    the Legislature desired to make vaccination compulsory it would\\r\\n    have so enacted. Whether it be within its power to do so, and\\r\\n    if so, by what means it may enforce such an enactment, are not\\r\\n    for discussion here.”\\r\\n\\r\\nJudge Woodward, of the New York Appellate Court, in the Viemeister case\\r\\nin 1903, declared that:\\r\\n\\r\\n    “It may be conceded that the Legislature has no constitutional\\r\\n    right to compel any person to submit to vaccination.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Supreme Court of the State of Massachusetts, in the case of\\r\\nJacobson in 1904, said:\\r\\n\\r\\n    “If a person should deem it important that vaccination should\\r\\n    not be performed in his case and the authorities should\\r\\n    think otherwise, _it is not in their power to vaccinate him\\r\\n    by force_, and the worst that could happen to him under the\\r\\n    statute would be the payment of the penalty of five dollars.”\\r\\n\\r\\nJudge Fitts, of the Supreme Court in Columbia County, New York, in the\\r\\ncase of Bollinger in February, 1909, charged the jury as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n    “I charge you, gentlemen of the jury, that the courts of this\\r\\n    State in construing the authority and power so conferred upon\\r\\n    local health officers who are the executive members of the\\r\\n    board or the local boards, have held that there is no warrant\\r\\n    or authority in law for the compulsory vaccination of any\\r\\n    individual.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the second trial of this case in February, 1910, Judge LeBœuf\\r\\ncharged the jury in these words:\\r\\n\\r\\n    “Now, I have charged you that this assault which is claimed to\\r\\n    have existed here, due to the forcible vaccination, if it was\\r\\n    a forcible vaccination, that is, if it was against this man’s\\r\\n    will, is one which you must consider. And the reason of that is\\r\\n    this: This man, in the eyes of the law, just as you and I and\\r\\n    all of us in this court-room, has the right to be let alone.\\r\\n    We all have the right to the freedom of our persons and that\\r\\n    freedom of our persons may not be unlawfully invaded. That is a\\r\\n    great right. It is one of the most important rights we have.”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES ON THE PREËMINENT RIGHTS OF THE\\r\\nINDIVIDUAL\\r\\n\\r\\nIn conclusion on this most vital point, let me call your special\\r\\nattention, Mr. President, to a most significant and important decision\\r\\nof the U. S. Supreme Court in the vaccination case of Jacobson _v._\\r\\nMassachusetts, rendered in 1905, on appeal from the Supreme Court of\\r\\nMassachusetts. In this long and interesting decision, one of its most\\r\\nclear and conclusive paragraphs emphatically declares the preëminent\\r\\nrights of the individual in certain spheres, as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n    “There is, of course, a sphere within which the individual may\\r\\n    assert the supremacy of his own will and rightfully dispute\\r\\n    the authority of any human government, especially of any free\\r\\n    government existing under a written constitution, to interfere\\r\\n    with the exercise of that will.”\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, what is this “sphere” within which this highest court\\r\\nin our land tells us so clearly and emphatically that “_the individual\\r\\nmay assert the supremacy of his own will and rightfully dispute the\\r\\nauthority of any human government, especially of any free government,\\r\\nexisting under a written constitution, to interfere with the exercise\\r\\nof that will_”?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe context both before and after this paragraph shows clearly that\\r\\nthis “sphere” of individual right and freedom exists wherever any\\r\\nunalienable or inherent natural right secured by our constitution is\\r\\ninvaded or violated, or where any act or practice forced upon the\\r\\nindividual is potentially or actually dangerous to the health or life\\r\\nof that individual, such as I have shown every act of vaccination to\\r\\nbe, in its very nature being an act of septicemic infection or blood\\r\\npoisoning pure and simple, which sometimes causes wide-spread epidemics\\r\\nand frequently causes serious injuries and many deaths, even more\\r\\ndeaths than smallpox itself, as has been demonstrated beyond question.\\r\\n\\r\\nSurely, therefore, there is no individual or personal right more\\r\\ninherent and natural and more sacred and obvious or more surely\\r\\nguaranteed in Declaration and Constitution than the right to medical\\r\\nfreedom of the body, the right to health and life and the right of\\r\\nthe individual to select and decide freely for himself the medical\\r\\ntreatment of his own body, and the right to guard it against any\\r\\nmedical treatment or operation which in his own judgment and conscience\\r\\nmay be unnecessary or undesirable or may involve great risk or\\r\\nsuffering to himself or may seriously endanger his health or life.\\r\\nThis right is, I think, so obvious, so fundamental and necessary and\\r\\nso unquestionable under the letter and spirit of our basic laws and\\r\\nconstitution, and by the decisions of our courts as well as by all\\r\\ncommon sense, logic and ethics, that I do not think another word of\\r\\nargument is necessary to establish this right in the conscientious\\r\\nconviction of every rational mind.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDECISION OF U. S. SUPREME COURT FURTHER ANALYZED\\r\\n\\r\\nIn further consideration of the meaning and significance of this\\r\\nimportant decision of the U. S. Supreme Court it may be now explained\\r\\nthat the law of Massachusetts here considered was a Statute passed by\\r\\nthe Legislature requiring the vaccination of all persons, child or\\r\\nadult, under penalty of fine of $5 for refusing vaccination. This law\\r\\nmade an exception for children or minors in delicate health or such\\r\\nphysical condition as would be injured by vaccination, but made no such\\r\\nexception for adults like the defendant Jacobson.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Supreme Court of the State of Massachusetts in its decision, from\\r\\nwhich this appeal was taken, had already decided, as I have shown,\\r\\nthat the State could not enforce actual compulsory vaccination upon any\\r\\nperson, but could only enforce the fine of $5 if vaccination was not\\r\\nvoluntarily adopted.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe U. S. Supreme Court concluded its decision in these words:\\r\\n\\r\\n    “We now decide only that the statute covers the present case,\\r\\n    and that nothing clearly appears that would justify this Court\\r\\n    in holding it to be unconstitutional and inoperative in its\\r\\n    application to the plaintiff in error.”\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom this conclusion Justices Brewer and Peckham dissented, thus\\r\\nevidently holding that the law of Massachusetts, which inflicts a\\r\\nfine of $5 for refusing vaccination, was unconstitutional, whereas\\r\\nthe majority of the Court seem to hold that this State law, which can\\r\\nenforce the fine but cannot compel the vaccination, was legal and\\r\\nconstitutional, but that nevertheless this fine could not be enforced\\r\\nagainst any persons who could show that vaccination was dangerous to\\r\\ntheir health and life, and that the Courts would interfere to prevent\\r\\nits enforcement in all such cases and thus protect the constitutional\\r\\nrights of the individual within that “sphere” of preëminent individual\\r\\nright as already quoted.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow it seems that the defendant Jacobson did not properly plead that\\r\\nvaccination was dangerous to health and life, in his own case, or offer\\r\\nto prove this, in his own case, and hence the decision was technically\\r\\ngiven against him, but really, in principle, for him; which decision,\\r\\nas we have shown, was rendered by a divided Court with two judges\\r\\ndissenting who evidently held that compulsory vaccination by fine, as\\r\\ncalled for in the law of Massachusetts, was unconstitutional.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe therefore believe that this decision, when properly applied, will\\r\\ninvalidate all forms of coercive vaccination, whether by inflicted\\r\\nfine, or by denial of some civic right, such as public education,\\r\\nwhenever the prosecuted case is properly tried on the correct legal\\r\\npleas and issues and carried up through our highest Courts on the\\r\\nprinciples laid down in this great decision and outlined in this\\r\\nanalysis.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nUNALIENABLE RIGHTS OF THE INDIVIDUAL _VERSUS_ RIGHTS OF MAJORITIES.\\r\\nFALSE IDEA OF THE SUPREMACY OF MAJORITIES SCORED\\r\\n\\r\\nWe often hear it stated that this is a government essentially of\\r\\nmajorities and that any majority can legally and properly force its\\r\\nopinion or will upon any minority, no matter how objectionable to the\\r\\nminority this law or will of the majority might be; and that it is the\\r\\nclear right of the majority thus to oppress itself upon the minority\\r\\nand the loyal duty of the minority to yield to this oppression, however\\r\\nodious.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis rank idea of the supremacy of majorities is, I believe, a great\\r\\nlegal and moral and cowardly mistake and a gross misconception of\\r\\nour Democratic American Government, because it entirely loses sight\\r\\nof the great basic principle of _inherent_ and _unalienable human\\r\\nrights_ which seems to have been first, or best, expressed in our\\r\\nimmortal Declaration of Rights. Therefore, under this basic principle\\r\\nof “unalienable” right, no majorities, however powerful, can legally\\r\\nor morally invade or set aside any of the “unalienable” or inseparable\\r\\nrights of the People, as this is obviously the clear significance and\\r\\nmeaning of the terms “unalienable rights,” as I have already shown.\\r\\nHence this fundamental American principle of “unalienable rights” calls\\r\\nin trumpet tones from the lines of the Declaration and Constitution and\\r\\ngives this warning to all majorities, however powerful: “Thus far shalt\\r\\nthou go but no farther, and here must thy power be stayed”--that is,\\r\\nstayed at the approach to every sacred inherent and unalienable right\\r\\nof the individual necessary to the life, liberty, health and happiness\\r\\nof the individual.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have often heard the phrase quoted, “This is a government of laws\\r\\nand not of men,” which is only another way of stating what I am here\\r\\ncontending for, viz., that this Government of Americanism is not based\\r\\nessentially on mere numbers or majorities of “men,” but chiefly on\\r\\nnaturally or divinely ordained _principles_ or “laws” of eternal human\\r\\nright and justice, and, more particularly and essentially, on the great\\r\\nbasic American law or principle of “Unalienable Rights” of the People,\\r\\nwhich is the great American “Sanctuary” of Liberty and Right that no\\r\\nmajority or minority can invade or profane.\\r\\n\\r\\nMajorities can, of course, properly prevail over minorities in\\r\\nall matters that are purely selective or elective or which can be\\r\\ndetermined only by preponderating vote, but cannot prevail over any\\r\\ndefined or established inherent, unalienable or constitutional right of\\r\\nthe individual, and it has often been well said that Constitutions are\\r\\nmade especially to protect minorities, and not majorities, who already\\r\\nhave the preponderant political and legislative power in their hands\\r\\nand do not need such protection.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMEDICAL FREEDOM AND ALIMENTARY FREEDOM ARE EQUALLY UNALIENABLE RIGHTS\\r\\nOF THE PEOPLE AND NECESSARY FOR HUMAN LIFE, LIBERTY AND HAPPINESS\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have already seen how compulsory medicine is a gross violation of\\r\\nthe American principle of Unalienable Rights and need say nothing\\r\\nfurther on that point here; but, as the exposure and condemnation of\\r\\none evil may show us the way to suppress another and similar evil,\\r\\nso it may be excusable for us to digress here for a moment from our\\r\\nmain subject and call attention to the fact that the same moral, legal\\r\\nand logical principles against Compulsory Medicine apply equally\\r\\nto that latest dangerous invasion of the unalienable rights of the\\r\\npeople involved in the extraordinary scheme of National Prohibition or\\r\\nCompulsory Abstinence in certain foods and drinks recently forced upon\\r\\nthe people by what is alleged to be a majority of the voters of this\\r\\ncountry. Now, I do not believe that any majority of our voters have\\r\\never approved either compulsory medicine or compulsory abstinence, but,\\r\\non the contrary, that these errors have been forced upon the people by\\r\\naudacious, well organized and arrogant minorities who have temporarily\\r\\ngotten control of political and legislative power and have deceived the\\r\\npublic mind with the alleged necessity, utility and righteousness of\\r\\nthese oppressive errors. But even if it can be shown that a majority\\r\\nof our voters approve either of these errors, such alleged majorities\\r\\nwould be morally and legally unjustified in overriding any inherent\\r\\nright of the people under our basic American doctrine and law of\\r\\nUnalienable Rights.\\r\\n\\r\\nI intend to treat, in a separate article, this important subject of\\r\\nAlimentary Freedom, in certain fermented foods and drinks, as an\\r\\nunalienable right of the people, established by world-wide and age-long\\r\\nusage and by the highest civic, moral, legal and religious sanctions,\\r\\nand need give no further attention to that special subject here.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMEDICAL DESPOTISM WORSE THAN RELIGIOUS DESPOTISM. THE OLD RELIGIOUS\\r\\nHERESY, “LET US SIN THAT GRACE MAY ABOUND,” COMPARED WITH THE MODERN\\r\\nVACCINATION FANATICISM, “LET US FORCE AND SPREAD DISEASE UPON THE\\r\\nPEOPLE SO THAT HEALTH MAY ABOUND!”\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the past centuries, before our great American Institutions of\\r\\nCivil and Religious Liberty were established, it was the Doctors of\\r\\nDivinity who were wholly responsible for inventing and maintaining that\\r\\ngreat evil of Compulsory Religion, where one type of religion or one\\r\\nconception of Deity was forced on the whole population under penalty of\\r\\ntorture, disfigurement, mutilation, or death; and these misguided men\\r\\nseem to have actually had the absurd and diabolical idea--incredible to\\r\\nus to-day--that by this mutilation and murder they could increase the\\r\\nsum total of morality in the whole community!\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a similar way, our modern doctors of medicine and our medical\\r\\nsocieties are wholly responsible for inventing and enforcing the\\r\\nhorrible medical scheme of compulsory disease, and with a similar logic\\r\\nthat, by thus forcing these vaccine operations and diseases on the\\r\\nwhole population, they can greatly increase the sum total of health in\\r\\nthe whole community!\\r\\n\\r\\nThis dogma of compulsory disease is, of course, just as false and evil\\r\\nas the dogma of compulsory religion; but, of the two evils, compulsory\\r\\ndisease is far more dangerous to human right and safety, health and\\r\\nlife, and it would probably not be difficult to prove that where\\r\\none person was mutilated or murdered by compulsory religion in the\\r\\nbarbarous past, ten are now injured or killed by the modern medical\\r\\nbarbarism of compulsory disease.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was an old sect of heretics about the time of the Reformation\\r\\nwhich seemed to have a poor idea of the value of personal virtue and\\r\\ngood works in salvation as compared with mere dogma, “grace,” and\\r\\n“faith,” and whose motto seemed to be: “The more sin, the more grace,”\\r\\nor “Let us sin that grace may abound.” Now, this seems to be very\\r\\nsimilar to the doctrine of the coercive vaccinators of to-day, which\\r\\nappears to be simply and literally this: “The more disease we inflict,\\r\\nthe more health we create,” or “Let us inflict and spread disease\\r\\nwidely upon the people so that health may correspondingly abound.”\\r\\n\\r\\nA striking example of the evil effects of this dangerous vaccine\\r\\ndoctrine in recent times is found in the case of Japan, whose awful\\r\\nrecord in vaccination and smallpox and in epidemic disease transmitted\\r\\nby vaccine virus is exposed in the next paragraphs.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAWFUL RECORD OF JAPAN IN VACCINATION AND SMALLPOX AND IN EPIDEMIC\\r\\nDISEASE CAUSED BY VACCINE VIRUS, AS GIVEN IN U. S. GOVERNMENT REPORTS\\r\\n\\r\\nJapan has been perhaps the most extensively vaccinated country in\\r\\nrecent times, with most rigid compulsory laws, copied from Germany,\\r\\nwhich require re-vaccination at different periods of infant and adult\\r\\nlife. Now vaccination, as I have already shown, is simply one of\\r\\nthe varied forms of smallpox, being an artificially propagated or\\r\\ncultivated form of the disease involving human smallpox and cowpox\\r\\ncombined, and is often more dangerous and deadly than the natural\\r\\ndisease. This being the fact, what therefore should we expect to\\r\\nresult from the dangerous practice of impregnating the blood of a\\r\\nwhole population with repeated inoculations of the virus of human\\r\\nsmallpox and cow disease? Should we logically expect anything else but\\r\\nthat epidemics of smallpox and cow disease should break out in due\\r\\ntime in such a generally vaccinated and infected population, and that\\r\\nvaccine or cow disease should be extended to other populations wherever\\r\\nthe virus made from human and cow diseases should be carried and used?\\r\\n\\r\\nThis logical expectation is what seems to have actually happened in the\\r\\ncase of much-vaccinated Japan, and instead of being made immune from\\r\\nsmallpox epidemics by general vaccination and re-vaccination--which is\\r\\none of the positive claims made by vaccinators--Japan, on the contrary,\\r\\nseems to have suffered from the worst epidemics of smallpox known in\\r\\nmodern times, not only worse than in poorly vaccinated countries like\\r\\nEngland and the United States, but worse than experienced in old times\\r\\nbefore the days of vaccination!\\r\\n\\r\\nThis conclusion seems to be fully proved from the U. S. Public Health\\r\\nReports for September 2, 1910, which give this frightful record of\\r\\nsmallpox epidemics in Japan for several years past. The population of\\r\\nJapan at that time, 1910, was about 48 millions, and the high waves\\r\\nin the epidemics in the preceding ten years were as follows: In 1898\\r\\nthere were 149,012 smallpox cases with 40,971 deaths, mortality 27½ per\\r\\ncent.; in 1905 there were 10,704 cases with 3,388 deaths, mortality\\r\\n31½ per cent., and in 1908 there were 18,075 cases with 5,835 deaths,\\r\\nmortality 32½ per cent.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese figures, considering the vaccinal conditions existing in Japan,\\r\\nunder most rigid compulsory laws, are surely terribly significant, to\\r\\nsay the least, and fully shatter the fallacious vaccine doctrine that\\r\\nvaccination is the only effective remedy against smallpox and that\\r\\nit always lowers the mortality in epidemics! Per contra, here we see\\r\\nfrom these official U. S. Health Reports that in this much-vaccinated\\r\\npopulation there was not only a series of severe epidemics with a very\\r\\nhigh mortality, but a constantly ascending mortality from 27½ per cent.\\r\\nin 1898 to 31½ per cent. in 1905 and 32½ per cent. in 1908! Whereas\\r\\nthe usual mortality given by good authorities in old times before\\r\\nthe days of vaccination was only 15 to 20 per cent.! See “History of\\r\\nSmallpox” by Dr. James Moore, Jenner’s chief assistant, London, 1815,\\r\\npage 243.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow I believe that there is no country in modern times, whether\\r\\nvaccinated or unvaccinated, which has shown worse epidemics of smallpox\\r\\nthan much-vaccinated Japan, as above shown from official data, whereas\\r\\nthe epidemics within the same period in the poorly vaccinated countries\\r\\nof England and the United States have been small in comparison.\\r\\nSurely, therefore, our “Yankees of the Orient” seem to have copied\\r\\nsome of our antique medical barbarisms even more fully than they have\\r\\ncopied our real modern improvements. And, surely, poorly vaccinated\\r\\nEngland is much better off with less vaccination and more sanitation\\r\\nwhen its Minister of Health, Hon. John Burns, can publicly declare in\\r\\nParliament on April 12, 1911, that, “Just in proportion as, in recent\\r\\nyears, exemptions from vaccination have gone up from 4 per cent. to 30\\r\\nper cent., so deaths from smallpox have declined.” This also is the\\r\\nexperience of Leicester, the sanitary English city, unvaccinated for\\r\\nthe past 30 years, as previously shown at page 22; and such, I believe,\\r\\nwill be the result wherever that irrational system of inflicting\\r\\ndisease to produce health is abandoned and the rational system of\\r\\nsanitation and hygiene is adopted in its place.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nJAPANESE VIRUS CAUSES EPIDEMICS OF CATTLE PLAGUE IN MANKIND AND ANIMALS\\r\\n\\r\\nNot only, therefore, has general compulsory vaccination failed to\\r\\nprotect Japan from some of the worst smallpox epidemics known in modern\\r\\nor olden times, as just shown, but, what is perhaps still more damning,\\r\\nit is proved by U. S. Government Reports, quoted on pages 95 and 99,\\r\\nthat Japanese vaccination was the source of the deadly epidemics of\\r\\nCattle Plague, known as “Foot and Mouth Disease,” which afflicted\\r\\nboth animals and mankind in the United States in 1902 and 1908, this\\r\\ndangerous infection being imported in vaccine virus from Japan and\\r\\nused by two of the largest makers of virus in the United States. See\\r\\nYear Book, U. S. Dept. of Agriculture, 1914, page 21. See also page\\r\\n99 in Supplement. These epidemics raged in several of our States, as\\r\\npreviously shown, and caused the slaughter of hundreds of thousands of\\r\\nanimals, an unknown amount of human mortality, and a loss of millions\\r\\nof dollars to the Government and people of this country. Surely such\\r\\nawful results from Japanese vaccination are a shocking mockery and a\\r\\nstinging rebuke to all vaccination as an alleged “health” remedy and\\r\\ncall loudly for the abolishment of all compulsory vaccination as a most\\r\\ndangerous public evil and a flagrant violation of vital human rights to\\r\\nMedical Freedom, Sanity and Safety.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMEDICAL FREEDOM NECESSARY FOR MEDICAL PROGRESS, MEDICAL TRUTH AND HUMAN\\r\\nSAFETY\\r\\n\\r\\nAs we now enjoy the great Democratic Institution of a Free Church in a\\r\\nFree State, with all church control of government and all compulsory or\\r\\nforced religion prohibited, so, in the near future, we must bring about\\r\\nan equally important reform for human welfare in preventing all medical\\r\\ncontrol of our departments of government, in securing true medical\\r\\nfreedom and prohibiting all compulsory medicine as effectually as all\\r\\ncompulsory religion and church control of government is now prohibited.\\r\\nAnd as full freedom for all religious sects, in religious matters,\\r\\nhas surely brought about an undoubted advance in religious progress\\r\\nand in true religion and morality throughout the world, so it is sure\\r\\nthat full medical freedom will bring about a similar increase in true\\r\\nmedical progress and efficiency throughout the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow in this most important reform of Medical Freedom I want to say at\\r\\nthis point that I hold no brief for any school of medicine or religion,\\r\\nbut what I contend for, as an American citizen, is something broader,\\r\\nmore inclusive, more American, and more important for public right,\\r\\nhealth and safety than any one religious or medical doctrine, and\\r\\nthat is a full Medical Freedom for all the people to adopt any honest\\r\\nor sincere doctrine or system of medicine which they may prefer,\\r\\nand a free public field for the exercise of this doctrine or system\\r\\nwithout any harassment or oppression from any other system of medicine\\r\\nwhich may falsely and foolishly think itself specially ordained to\\r\\ncontrol the whole field of medicine. And just as we now enjoy a full\\r\\nconstitutional guarantee for Religious Freedom, which prevents any one\\r\\nsect from infringing on the conscientious liberty of another, so we\\r\\nmust have a full Medical Freedom with an equal guarantee which will\\r\\ngive all honest or reasonable medical doctrines free scope and prevent\\r\\nany medical doctrine or practice whatever from being forced on any\\r\\nperson against free will and consent, and which will recognize the\\r\\nfull right of the individual to adopt any preferred system of medical\\r\\ntreatment, whether with or without prayer and faith, with or without\\r\\ndrugs and medicines, or with or without vaccines or serums.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis broad medical freedom for all systems of medicine is absolutely\\r\\nnecessary for true medical progress itself, for only by testing\\r\\nthese different medical theories and practices side by side freely\\r\\nin every-day experience and on a wide scale can the real truth and\\r\\nvirtue of any particular doctrine or practice be determined. A great\\r\\nmodern doctor uttered a most important truth on this head when he said\\r\\nthat “He is the best doctor who knows the uselessness and dangers of\\r\\nthe greatest number of remedies.” And the best way of finding out the\\r\\nuselessness, danger or virtue of any remedies is to try them carefully\\r\\nand freely side by side. And this free use and disuse of alleged\\r\\nremedies side by side in contrast or competition will ultimately sift\\r\\nout and condemn whatever is really evil or useless more effectually\\r\\nand justly than any drastic compulsion or dogmatic suppression could\\r\\npossibly do, thus making the best and surest contribution to true\\r\\nmedical progress, safety and efficiency.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the same principle, if all compulsory vaccination is abolished and\\r\\neach person left free to adopt or refuse vaccination, as he sees\\r\\nfit--which is his positive legal right--a true test of the virtue and\\r\\nsafety or uselessness and danger of general vaccination will soon be\\r\\narrived at. And if it can be shown in such a large and free test that\\r\\nthe unvaccinated part of the population or the unvaccinated part of\\r\\nthe Army and Navy is no more liable, on the average, to catch smallpox\\r\\nor typhoid fever than the vaccinated part, and is entirely free from\\r\\nthe grave dangers of vaccination itself, surely a great lesson in\\r\\nmedical sanity and progress will be learned. As a matter of fact, this\\r\\ntest has already proved in the case of the U. S. Army in France that\\r\\ntyphoid vaccination is useless as a preventive where sanitation is\\r\\ngrossly neglected. See pages 207 and 210. It has also proved in the\\r\\ncase of poorly vaccinated but sanitary England and particularly in the\\r\\nunvaccinated and very sanitary City of Leicester, as compared with much\\r\\nvaccinated Japan, Germany and Berlin, that good sanitation, isolation\\r\\nand hygiene without vaccination give the best result in reducing and\\r\\npreventing smallpox in the population and also in greatly reducing the\\r\\ngeneral death-rate and infant death-rate as compared to the same rates\\r\\nin the heavily vaccinated communities named. On this point see one of\\r\\nthe latest medical works on this subject by a pro-vaccinator, “The\\r\\nVaccination Question,” by Dr. Millard, London, 1914.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, as medical freedom is absolutely necessary for true medical\\r\\nprogress, as just shown, so it is equally necessary for medical truth\\r\\nand human safety. At this point I am sure it will be readily admitted\\r\\nthat even if an alleged medical remedy were absolutely effective and\\r\\nsure, and absolutely safe, harmless, and beneficial, it would not\\r\\nbe ethically or legally proper to force it upon any patient against\\r\\nfree will and consent. But when an alleged remedy is very uncertain,\\r\\ndoubtful or irregular in its action, or very dangerous and frequently\\r\\nfatal in its effects, such as vaccination has been proved to be, surely\\r\\nthe forcing of such a doubtful and dangerous remedy on any person under\\r\\npretense of its necessity and harmlessness is not only unethical but it\\r\\nis a question whether this is not also a gross act of sheer criminal\\r\\nmalpractice.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen, therefore, any doctor forces such a doubtful and dangerous remedy\\r\\nas vaccination upon any patient under the pretense that it is necessary\\r\\nfor public health and is perfectly safe and harmless, the doctor is\\r\\nobviously under a most vicious moral and professional bias and interest\\r\\nto conceal, deny or falsify any unfavorable facts that may arise in\\r\\nthe case, such as the failure of the alleged remedy or its injurious\\r\\nor possibly fatal effects on the patient, which bias and falsification\\r\\nis of course the greatest enemy to medical truth, safety and progress.\\r\\nAnd it is obvious that this concealment and denial of the injurious or\\r\\nfatal effects of medical remedies forced on the people by doctors is\\r\\nnot only against true public policy but is a gross violation of true\\r\\nmedical ethics and a crime upon the people in the falsification of this\\r\\nmost important point of vital statistics, viz., the nature and effects\\r\\nof alleged medical remedies on human health and life, which facts\\r\\nshould surely be fully disclosed to the public, not only for the sake\\r\\nof medical truth and progress but for the greater reason of human right\\r\\nand safety.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd it must be here remembered that our vaccinating doctors and our\\r\\ndominant vaccinating medical sect have now such full control of our\\r\\ndeath certificates, our departments of health and vital statistics\\r\\nthat they can deny or conceal the effect of their medical operations\\r\\nwith the greatest ease and safety, which is obviously a very sinister\\r\\nfact, against the most vital interest of the people, in public health,\\r\\nmedical truth and safety and accurate vital statistics, and this evil\\r\\nsurely calls for an immediate reform.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the other hand, where medical practice is perfectly free and\\r\\nvoluntary, the practitioner has no bias or interest whatever to make\\r\\nfalse claims of alleged efficiency or to conceal facts as to failures,\\r\\ndangers and fatalities, so that it is therefore obvious that for\\r\\nboth medical truth and progress and human right and safety, Medical\\r\\nFreedom is an absolute public necessity, and that, per contra, Medical\\r\\nCompulsion is a most dangerous public evil which must be abolished as\\r\\ncompletely as the less dangerous evil of religious compulsion has been\\r\\nabolished.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMEDICAL DOMINATION AND COMPULSION MOST DANGEROUS POWER IN BODY POLITIC\\r\\nAND MUST BE SUPPRESSED\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most dangerous power in the body politic of the past age was formed\\r\\nby the organized intolerant and oppressive Doctors of Divinity, who had\\r\\na great State Church and political organization behind them through\\r\\nwhich they dominated and coerced the people and by which they were\\r\\nenabled legally to force upon them the horrible, but now obsolete, evil\\r\\nof compulsory religion, as well illustrated in some of our early New\\r\\nEngland Colonies and in many other places throughout the Old and New\\r\\nWorlds, during the past centuries. And so, in a similar way, it is the\\r\\nDoctors of Medicine and the Medical Societies of one great dominating\\r\\nschool or sect, the vaccine sect, which form the most dangerous\\r\\npower in the body politic to-day, and are almost wholly responsible\\r\\nfor originating and forcing upon the people the barbarous evil of\\r\\ncompulsory medicine and compulsory disease, in violation of the most\\r\\nfundamental, inherent, natural, and constitutional rights of the people.\\r\\n\\r\\nPresident Lincoln--who was one of our greatest Americans--has told\\r\\nus that no man, however good, is fit to govern another man without\\r\\nthe latter’s consent, and I think it will be generally admitted, as a\\r\\nsound Democratic and American doctrine, that no one class or profession\\r\\nof men--not even the great clerical or medical profession--is quite\\r\\nperfect enough to be trusted with exclusive, unlimited or dangerous\\r\\npower over our fellow men. Nevertheless it is a fact that the medical\\r\\nprofession, as now organized and possessed of political and official\\r\\npower, and in control of some of our most important departments of\\r\\ngovernment, such as Public Health, Vital Statistics and Medical\\r\\nLegislation, has already a most dangerous power over the people,\\r\\nperhaps more dangerous and unlimited than any other class of men, and\\r\\nthis dangerous power must be curbed as soon and as much as possible in\\r\\nthe interest of true Medical Freedom and Progress and public right and\\r\\nsafety.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy late esteemed friend and neighbor, the illustrious Judge Gaynor,\\r\\nNew York’s greatest mayor, uttered one of his best sayings, which we\\r\\nmay well note and apply here, when he said: “Beware of the men or the\\r\\nclass who are too anxious to exert power.” And this warning we can\\r\\nnow apply most pertinently to our dominating medical societies and\\r\\nvaccine companies, which together form a most gigantic medical interest\\r\\nwhich is the chief influence that has forced compulsory medicine and\\r\\ninflicted disease upon the people and controls our Departments of\\r\\nHealth, and which should be fully investigated by the Executive and\\r\\nLegislative Departments of our State and National governments, which\\r\\nshould adopt some radical reforms to curb this dangerous medical power\\r\\nand safeguard the rights of the people, as suggested in the next\\r\\nparagraph.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE GIGANTIC MEDICAL AND VACCINE INTEREST SUPPORTING COMPULSORY\\r\\nVACCINATION A MENACE TO PUBLIC RIGHT AND SAFETY WHICH SHOULD BE CURBED\\r\\n\\r\\nThe latest official reports show that there are now _ninety-nine_\\r\\nconcerns licensed by the U. S. Government to manufacture vaccines and\\r\\nserums for both human and animal uses! These ninety-nine concerns have\\r\\na capitalization of about fifty millions or more. One of the largest of\\r\\nthese manufacturers, located in Detroit, has a capital of ten millions,\\r\\nwhile another large concern located in Philadelphia has a capital of\\r\\ntwo millions.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two great epidemics of Foot and Mouth Disease, or virulent cowpox,\\r\\nin this country in 1902 and 1908 were caused by the vaccine virus of\\r\\ntwo of these ninety-nine vaccine manufacturers; and these epidemics\\r\\nresulted in great mortality to animals and mankind, as already shown,\\r\\nwith a loss of millions of dollars to the Government and people of the\\r\\nUnited States; but no recompense has ever yet been made, so far as I\\r\\nknow, to the Government or People by these vaccine companies for this\\r\\ngreat damage, and I ask your particular attention, Mr. President, to\\r\\nthis important point.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, to give a list of all the medical societies in the United States\\r\\nand their membership figures would take too much space here, as their\\r\\nnames and numbers are “legion”; but I can give some figures which will\\r\\ninclude the chief National Society and the chief State societies in the\\r\\nleading State of New York, as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n  American Medical Association                43,000 members\\r\\n  Medical Society, State of N. Y.              8,000    ”\\r\\n  Associated Physicians of Long Island           503    ”\\r\\n  Brooklyn Medical Association                   200    ”\\r\\n  Medical Society of Kings County                950    ”\\r\\n  Harlem Medical Association                     400    ”\\r\\n  Medical Association, Greater City of N. Y.     750    ”\\r\\n  Medical Society of County of N. Y.           2,709    ”\\r\\n  N. Y. Academy of Medicine                    1,400    ”\\r\\n\\r\\nThis table, while including only a partial list of medical\\r\\nsocieties in the United States, comprises some of the largest and most\\r\\ninfluential societies of the dominant or allopathic school, active in\\r\\nthe national field and in our own local field of New York State. Now\\r\\neach State in the Union has a similar group of local or State societies\\r\\nand these several State societies combined with the big National\\r\\nsocieties and with the _ninety-nine vaccine companies_ form, obviously,\\r\\na most gigantic medical, political and commercial interest behind the\\r\\nmedical evil of compulsory vaccination. Of course, a great many doctors\\r\\nof this dominant school are advanced and progressive enough to oppose\\r\\nall compulsory vaccination; but doctors of this type unfortunately\\r\\nseem to be a minority, at present, in the dominant vaccine school\\r\\nof medicine. On the other hand, a large majority in almost all of\\r\\nthe other schools of medicine are strongly opposed to vaccination,\\r\\nparticularly to all forms of compulsion.\\r\\n\\r\\nA glance at this list of medical societies already given, with its\\r\\nstartling membership figures, combined with the _ninety-nine vaccine\\r\\ncompanies_, must convince any thoughtful man of the dangerous size and\\r\\norganization of these medical and vaccine interests, which obviously\\r\\nhave more or less of a joint interest to force their vaccine operations\\r\\nand products upon the people as much as possible by compulsory laws,\\r\\nand otherwise, and whose joint profits are obviously in direct\\r\\nproportion to this use.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, no other profession has anything like the large and well organized\\r\\nmembership and corresponding political power and influence of the\\r\\nmedical profession in the body politic. Indeed, few, if any, trade or\\r\\nbusiness organizations can compare with the medical profession in this\\r\\nrespect, and this medical power is further greatly increased beyond\\r\\nthat of any other profession, trade or business in being in practical\\r\\ncontrol of our most important Departments of Public Health and Vital\\r\\nStatistics all over the country, so that in advocating and practising\\r\\nthe dangerous barbarism of compulsory medicine this medical power can\\r\\neasily deny and conceal the actual effects of this dangerous medication\\r\\non human health and life in our vital statistics. This is surely too\\r\\nmuch power and a power too dangerous to be left in the hands of one\\r\\nclass or profession of men, and it would surely be an act of public\\r\\nwisdom to take this control of our Departments of Health and Vital\\r\\nStatistics out of the hands of this one medical class and entrust it\\r\\nto doctors of various schools or to some other professions, such as\\r\\nsanitary engineers, expert lay statisticians, life insurance actuaries,\\r\\nor even to able laymen, who would have no professional bias or interest\\r\\nto deny or conceal any medical mistakes or disasters, but who would\\r\\nhonestly give to the public the true record, not only of deaths\\r\\nfrom natural diseases, but--what is even more important for public\\r\\ninformation, public health, and medical progress--the true record of\\r\\ndisease and death from all _artificial or inflicted diseases_ and\\r\\nmedical operations in general.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nREFORMED SYSTEM LONG USED IN ENGLAND\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a matter of fact, the reformed system here suggested has long been\\r\\nin use in England, where the Minister of Health and the Registrar\\r\\nGeneral have been both eminent laymen, and not doctors, but with\\r\\nhonest doctors under them, and where the record for sanitation and\\r\\npublic health is one of the highest and the death-rate one of the\\r\\nlowest in the world, while vaccination is constantly declining. Under\\r\\nthis system the English vital statistics are also known to be the\\r\\nmost full and reliable in the world, and deaths from vaccination\\r\\nand other medical practices are not denied and concealed, as in our\\r\\ndoctor-controlled Departments, but are reported honestly and regularly\\r\\nevery year, showing in many years a greater mortality from vaccination\\r\\nthan from smallpox.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis medical and statistical reform should be immediately adopted in\\r\\nthis country to abolish the dangerous medical domination and monopoly\\r\\nwhich now controls our Departments and which has long been an abuse\\r\\nof public power by one medical sect, a great enemy to Medical Truth,\\r\\nFreedom and Progress and an arbitrary power in our body politic which\\r\\nshould be no longer tolerated under our American institutions.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPROPOSED NATIONAL BOARD OF PUBLIC HEALTH, CONTROLLED BY ONE SCHOOL OF\\r\\nDOCTORS, CONDEMNED\\r\\n\\r\\nA typical instance of the dangerous tendency of the medical profession\\r\\nto extend its power over the people is shown in the recent scheme of\\r\\nthe proposed National Department of Public Health, to be composed\\r\\nchiefly of doctors of one sect, with a head doctor having a seat in the\\r\\nPresident’s Cabinet.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, a National Department of Public Health, properly organized and\\r\\nconducted, may be a very good thing for the public welfare, but such\\r\\na Department should by no means be controlled by doctors of one\\r\\ndominating sect or by the big vaccine interests in alliance with it,\\r\\nbut all schools of medicine should be properly and fairly represented\\r\\nin such a Department, and its head member, having a seat in the\\r\\nCabinet, should be an able and eminent layman and not a medical\\r\\ndoctor, so that the head of the Department would thus represent the\\r\\ninterests of the whole people and not chiefly the professional ideas\\r\\nand interests of one school of medicine.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMEDICAL ETHICS OF THE VACCINE AND OTHER SCHOOLS COMPARED AND\\r\\nCRITICIZED. THE “BEAM” _VERSUS_ THE “MOTE”\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat would be thought of the “medical ethics” of an imaginary or\\r\\nhypothetical doctor who might invent some medical remedy and then have\\r\\nlaws passed to force this alleged remedy upon his patients against free\\r\\nwill and consent, but to his own profit, and who might at the same\\r\\ntime get control of the Departments of Health and Vital Statistics so\\r\\nthat he could safely and successfully deny and conceal the failures,\\r\\ndangers and fatalities of his alleged remedy or invention? Could there\\r\\nbe conceived a medical policy or practice of greater professional\\r\\neffrontery, impudence and wicked presumption than this? Could there\\r\\nbe a medical practice of greater danger to human right and safety and\\r\\nmore shocking and destructive to all true medical ethics and progress?\\r\\nCould there be any practice more violative of the inalienable rights of\\r\\nthe American citizen? And yet this hypothetical picture illustrates,\\r\\nsubstantially, the medical policy which the people now suffer from in\\r\\nevery community oppressed with the evil of compulsory vaccination,\\r\\nand which would be greatly aggravated if we were to have a National\\r\\nDepartment of Health controlled by vaccinating doctors.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have heard a good deal from the medical societies as to the evils\\r\\nof the “Quack” doctor, the “Patent Medicine” man and the Christian\\r\\nScientist, who are severely frowned upon by the regular doctor and\\r\\npro-vaccinator; but these men, much abused by their alleged superiors,\\r\\nhave never been guilty of anything so violative of true medical\\r\\nethics and of public right and safety as the practice of forcing\\r\\nmedical remedies and operations upon their patients against free will\\r\\nand consent, or the practice of representing remedies as absolutely\\r\\nnecessary and perfectly safe and harmless which are in fact not\\r\\nnecessary and are highly dangerous, and not only frequently kill the\\r\\npatient but actually cause great epidemics of fatal diseases in animals\\r\\nand mankind, such as the deadly epidemics of foot and mouth disease in\\r\\n1902 and 1908, already described, which were caused by inoculations\\r\\nwith the vaccine virus from two of the biggest vaccine factories in the\\r\\nUnited States.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow I have never heard that any “Quacks” or “Patent Medicine” doctors\\r\\nor Christian Scientists or any other school of medicine, good, bad or\\r\\nindifferent, have ever been guilty of any damage to health and life\\r\\ncomparable to this awful record of the vaccine school, which school\\r\\nseems to arrogate to itself such superiority and dominance over its\\r\\nfellow men. So far as the average “patent” medicines are concerned,\\r\\nthey may be said to be of three classes: First, harmless or agreeable\\r\\nmixtures having no actual effect on disease, good or bad, except in\\r\\nthe fancy or faith of the patient. Second, mixtures of ordinary drugs\\r\\nsubstantially such as the regular doctors prescribe. Third, at the\\r\\nworst, nothing worse than mixtures of medicated “booze” or doctored\\r\\n“dope.” Per contra, I never heard of any “Patent” or “Quack” medicine\\r\\nwhich was an actual _blood poison_ or the actual virus of some\\r\\ndangerous or deadly infection capable of infecting the patient with\\r\\nsome fatal disease and of killing him in a few minutes, hours, days or\\r\\nweeks, as frequently happens with different forms of vaccination, as I\\r\\nhave already demonstrated beyond doubt in these pages.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo this dangerously dominating vaccine sect of medicine, which sees the\\r\\nfaults of other men but not its own great errors, we may therefore now\\r\\napply the crushing words of Christ in His great parable of the beam and\\r\\nthe mote, as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n    “And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother’s eye,\\r\\n    but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?”\\r\\n\\r\\n    “Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye;\\r\\n    and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy\\r\\n    brother’s eye.”\\r\\n\\r\\nYes, Mr. President, if this powerfully organized and dominating sect of\\r\\nmedicine, which now has such a dangerous power in our body politic,\\r\\nwill cast out the blinding “beams” of compulsory medicine, inflicted\\r\\ndisease and medical falsification out of its mental eyes it may then\\r\\nbe able to see clearly to cast out the relatively harmless medical\\r\\n“motes” out of the eyes of our fellow men. But I am afraid that we\\r\\ncannot rely on this Profession to correct its own great faults unaided,\\r\\nor that, like the old Pharisee, it will ever remove from its own eyes\\r\\nthe blinding beams of medical self-righteousness, infallibility,\\r\\ndomination, compulsion and falsification. It will undoubtedly require\\r\\nthe logical common sense and moral sense of the laity to bring about\\r\\nthis medical reform, as few creeds, professions or parties ever reform\\r\\nthemselves from within, but generally by moral and logical force from\\r\\nwithout. Left to itself, the Profession would undoubtedly acknowledge\\r\\nand correct its present great errors of Bovine Vaccination, compulsion\\r\\nand falsification in due time, but this reform would probably not\\r\\noccur voluntarily for a century yet!--that is, in about one hundred\\r\\nyears after we were all dead. Indeed, the record of History seems to\\r\\nshow that it usually requires about a century for this most dogmatic\\r\\nand infallibilistic sect of medicine to correct any of its gigantic\\r\\nmistakes. For instance: The awful mistake of smallpox inoculation\\r\\nwas continued for over a century, endorsed by the highest medical\\r\\nauthorities as the only way to prevent smallpox, and yet it was finally\\r\\nabandoned and prohibited by public opinion and penal law as being one\\r\\nof the most dangerous and effective ways to propagate and multiply\\r\\nsmallpox. And it was not till after this gigantic medical mistake\\r\\nwas prohibited that natural smallpox began to seriously decline.\\r\\nIn the same way the vile medical scheme of arm-to-arm vaccination\\r\\ncontinued for over half a century under the endorsement of a large\\r\\npart of the medical profession as a safe substitute for inoculation,\\r\\nand as perfectly harmless and effective, and yet it was ultimately\\r\\ncondemned and abandoned as one of the vilest schemes ever devised for\\r\\ntransmitting the most dangerous human and animal diseases from one\\r\\nperson to another! Now I believe that the present medical evil of\\r\\nCompulsory Bovine Vaccination is worse than any of the former mistakes\\r\\nas involving the extensive diseasing of two classes of animals, cattle\\r\\nand mankind, and causing epidemics of the most dangerous diseases in\\r\\nmankind and domestic animals which were not known under the former\\r\\nevil schemes of inoculation and arm-to-arm vaccination! We must not,\\r\\ntherefore, now wait for a century more to allow the bovine vaccinators\\r\\nand compulsory doctors voluntarily to abandon and correct what is\\r\\nperhaps the greatest medical mistake in history, but we must bring\\r\\nabout this reform at once, in our own day, by a proper exertion of\\r\\nthe common sense and the moral sense of the laity in enacting new\\r\\nlaws which will prohibit all medical compulsion and all propagated\\r\\nand inflicted disease, and which will also remove all vaccinating\\r\\ndoctors from the head and control of our Departments of Health and\\r\\nVital Statistics and put in their places able laymen, or men of neutral\\r\\nprofessions, who will do justice to all medical sects and schools and\\r\\nprotect and enforce the legal rights of the people to _Medical Freedom_\\r\\nand _Safety_ and to _Medical and Statistical Truth_.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPROPAGATION AND INFLICTION OF DISEASE A MEDICAL CRIME\\r\\n\\r\\nThe extensive propagation and coercive infliction of a dangerous\\r\\ndisease, under the false pretense that it is necessary for public\\r\\ngood and is safe and harmless, is obviously in the nature of a gross\\r\\nmedical malpractice and public crime which is against public policy and\\r\\npublic health and should be abolished by Penal Law, just as Smallpox\\r\\nInoculation was abolished nearly a century ago.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nREMOVAL OF THE GREAT ETHICAL DISGRACE OF THE MEDICAL PROFESSION\\r\\n\\r\\nI have not the least doubt that the best doctors in all our present\\r\\nschools of medicine, including the allopathic, will hail the broad\\r\\nreform of Medical Freedom which I am here urging and which they will\\r\\nreadily see will be a great benefit to Humanity and to the whole\\r\\n“Divine” Profession of Healing and will be the removal from it of\\r\\nsomething which the verdict of History will undoubtedly record\\r\\nas having been the greatest Ethical Disgrace on the whole Medical\\r\\nProfession. And as the abolishment of compulsory religion removed\\r\\na great disgrace from the Clerical Profession in the past, so the\\r\\nabolishment of compulsory medicine will remove a great disgrace from\\r\\nthe Medical Profession of to-day. And the doctors will doubtless, in\\r\\ndue time, regret that they were ever guilty of such a barbarism, as\\r\\nmuch as modern Churchmen now regret the similar barbarous mistake of\\r\\ntheir predecessors.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRECAPITULATION\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is, therefore, to this great medical reform, Mr. President, that I\\r\\nnow ask your careful attention and forceful help, so far as may lie\\r\\nwithin your power or may commend itself to your conscientious judgment;\\r\\nand I now briefly recapitulate the essential points in this much needed\\r\\nreform, as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n    FIRST: The abolishment of all compulsory vaccination in the\\r\\n    Army and Navy, leaving vaccination free and voluntary with each\\r\\n    man, as it now is in the English Army.\\r\\n\\r\\n    SECOND: The full pardon of all men condemned by Court-Martial\\r\\n    for refusing compulsory vaccination.\\r\\n\\r\\n    THIRD: The thorough investigation of the propagation and\\r\\n    distribution of inflicted diseases by vaccine factories and\\r\\n    vaccinating doctors, and the effect of this dangerous practice\\r\\n    on the health and life of animals and mankind and its possible\\r\\n    or actual relation to great human and animal epidemics,\\r\\n    including epidemic Influenza and Pneumonia.\\r\\n\\r\\n    FOURTH: To determine carefully the number of cases of sickness\\r\\n    and death caused annually, directly or indirectly, by\\r\\n    vaccinations of different kinds in the Army and Navy and in the\\r\\n    civil population.\\r\\n\\r\\n    FIFTH: To have all deaths caused by vaccination or other\\r\\n    medical operations reported truly every year by all Medical\\r\\n    Boards and Boards of Health, and to have heavy penalties\\r\\n    enacted for all wilful denials or concealments of such deaths\\r\\n    in death certificates or other vital records and statistics.\\r\\n\\r\\n    SIXTH: To have various schools of medicine represented on all\\r\\n    Medical Boards and Boards of Health in order to prevent medical\\r\\n    monopoly by any one school of medicine and to establish Medical\\r\\n    Freedom for all schools, with greater benefit to the public\\r\\n    service, thus promoting true medical progress and efficiency.\\r\\n\\r\\n    SEVENTH: To have able laymen or sanitary engineers or life\\r\\n    insurance statisticians at the head of all Departments of\\r\\n    Health and Vital Statistics, with honest doctors under them,\\r\\n    like the good system long in use in England.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCONCLUSION\\r\\n\\r\\nIn your Message to Congress, August 8, 1919, Mr. President, you\\r\\nexpressed a very strong and interesting thought in condemnation of all\\r\\nunjust, arbitrary and coercive forces in the body politic, and the\\r\\nnecessity of suppressing them in the interest of human welfare. This\\r\\nthought applies most aptly in the present case against the evils of\\r\\ndominating, arbitrary and coercive Medicalism, and I am therefore very\\r\\nglad to quote it here as my closing sentence, where, it seems to me, it\\r\\nhas the force of a whole chapter in the space of one small paragraph.\\r\\n\\r\\n    “The world has just destroyed the arbitrary force of a military\\r\\n    Junta. It will live under no other. All that is arbitrary and\\r\\n    coercive is in the discard. Those who seek to employ it will\\r\\n    only prepare their own destruction.”\\r\\n\\r\\n  Respectfully submitted,\\r\\n\\r\\n  CHAS. M.

He was born on January\\r\\n10, 1841, at Johnstone near Paisley in Scotland. In 1846 his parents\\r\\nremoved to the United States and settled in Allegheny City, now a part\\r\\nof Pittsburgh; and there he received an elementary education in the\\r\\npublic schools. At the age of fourteen he began his business career\\r\\nin the office of the Superintendent of the Pennsylvania Railroad, at\\r\\nAltoona. In subsequent years he became Assistant to the Superintendent\\r\\nof the Pittsburgh, Fort Wayne & Chicago Railroad, and Assistant to\\r\\nthe Superintendent of the Philadelphia Division of the Pennsylvania\\r\\nRailroad. On February 22, 1861, he had charge of the train that\\r\\nconveyed Abraham Lincoln from Harrisburg to Philadelphia, on the way\\r\\nto the Presidential inaugural at Washington; and when the Confederates\\r\\ninvaded Pennsylvania before the Battle of Antietam he and his brother,\\r\\nRobert Pitcairn, were sent by Colonel Thomas A. Scott, then Assistant\\r\\nSecretary of War, to Chambersburg, to take charge of the train service\\r\\nfor the Government. He afterward became Assistant Superintendent of\\r\\nthe Middle Division of the Pennsylvania Railroad and Superintendent of\\r\\nthe Middle Division of the Philadelphia & Erie Railroad. He built the\\r\\nImperial Refinery at Oil City; and while associated with H. L. Taylor\\r\\n& Company, then the largest producers of oil in America, was engaged\\r\\nin the production, refining and pipe line transportation of oil. He\\r\\nwas also a member of the firm of Vandergrift, Pitcairn & Company, and,\\r\\nwith Mr. Vandergrift, built and controlled the first pipe line for the\\r\\nutilization of natural gas for manufacturing purposes and controlled\\r\\nthe Natural Gas Company, Limited. In 1883, Mr. Pitcairn, in association\\r\\nwith Captain John B. Ford and others, organized the Pittsburgh Plate\\r\\nGlass Company, of the Board of Directors of which he was the Chairman\\r\\nuntil 1897, when he purchased the interests of the Fords and became\\r\\nthe President of the Company; this office he resigned in 1905, again\\r\\nbecoming Chairman of the Board. The capital was originally $600,000;\\r\\nthis was increased at various times until it reached $2,750,000; later\\r\\nit became $10,000,000 and finally, $22,750,000, all representing\\r\\nreal values. Mr. Pitcairn was also President of the C. H. Wheeler\\r\\nManufacturing Company, the Loyal Hanna Coal and Coke Company, and the\\r\\nPittsburgh Valve and Fittings Company, and a Director of the Central\\r\\nNational Bank of Philadelphia, the Columbia Chemical Company, the\\r\\nMichigan Chemical Company, the Natural Gas Company of West Virginia,\\r\\nand the Owosso Sugar Company. In these important business connections\\r\\nand in many other fields of successful enterprise, he remained\\r\\nunremittingly active until the autumn of 1915, when he suffered an\\r\\nattack of pneumonia, from the after effects of which he died, at his\\r\\nresidence, “Cairnwood,” Bryn Athyn, Pa., on July 22, 1916.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the last ten years of his life, Mr. Pitcairn was to a great\\r\\nextent the guiding spirit of the anti-vaccination movement in America.\\r\\nIt would be impossible to chronicle his activities in its behalf\\r\\nwithout writing a voluminous history. In 1908 Mr. Pitcairn made\\r\\npossible by his liberality a National Anti-Vaccination Conference,\\r\\nwhich held its sessions in Griffith Hall, Philadelphia, on October\\r\\n19, 20 and 21 of that year, and which led to the organization of The\\r\\nAnti-Vaccination League of America. To _The Ladies’ Home Journal_ for\\r\\nMay, 1910, he contributed an article on “The Fallacy of Vaccination,”\\r\\nwhich has reached several million readers. On December 1, 1911, he\\r\\nwas appointed by Governor Tener a member of the Pennsylvania State\\r\\nVaccination Commission, and in this capacity on March 12, 1913,\\r\\nhe rendered his report, which is a clear, scholarly and readable\\r\\ncontribution to the literature of anti-vaccination.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Pitcairn’s personal attributes were the natural products of his\\r\\nScotch ancestry, his vigorous constitution, and his training in the\\r\\nschool of experience, matured by close association with many of\\r\\nthe most eminent minds of his time, extensive travels, and broad\\r\\nculture. He had an innate love of freedom, and hatred of injustice and\\r\\noppression; and these high qualities of his character were enlivened by\\r\\na keen sense of humor and deepened by positive religious convictions.\\r\\nAs a practical man, his faculties of perception were clear, his\\r\\ndeductions were accurate, his judgment of values was correct, and he\\r\\nwas constant in the pursuit of his purposes. But above all, he was\\r\\na man of independence in thought, of moral courage in action, and\\r\\nmagnetic and winning in his personality, so that it has been well said\\r\\nof him, as Sir Walter Scott said of Roderick,\\r\\n\\r\\n  “_One blast upon his bugle horn\\r\\n  Were worth a thousand men._”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe office of The Anti-Vaccination League of America is at 1420\\r\\nChestnut Street, Philadelphia, Pa. Mr. Porter F. Cope, Secretary; Mr.\\r\\nC. Oscar Beasley, Vice-President.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe office of The National Anti-Vaccination League, London, is at\\r\\n25 Denison House, Vauxhall Bridge Road, London, S. W. Miss L. Loat,\\r\\nSecretary.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  PETITION TO THE PRESIDENT\\r\\n  TO ABOLISH COMPULSORY\\r\\n  VACCINATION\\r\\n\\r\\n  PICTORIAL SUPPLEMENT\\r\\n  EXPOSING AND ILLUSTRATING HORRORS\\r\\n  OF VACCINATION\\r\\n\\r\\n  _By_ CHAS.

How cattle are diseased and tortured and Vaccine\\r\\nVirus produced.]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy referring to the cut on this page it will be seen that the living\\r\\ncalf or heifer is first bound down on a movable tilting table, and its\\r\\nbelly is shaved and on the clean, tender skin of a most tender part\\r\\none or two hundred cuts or scratches are then made, as shown, and into\\r\\nthese cuts or scratches is rubbed some “seed virus,” obtained directly\\r\\nor indirectly from human smallpox, and other known or unknown human or\\r\\nanimal infections. But just what infections this “seed virus” contains\\r\\nit seems impossible to find out, and it seems also that even the virus\\r\\nmakers themselves either do not know definitely what they are using\\r\\nand making, or will not state. But they certainly should be compelled\\r\\nby law to disclose fully the exact nature and origin of their viruses,\\r\\nand to publish the same clearly and openly, and should also be rigidly\\r\\nbonded to the State and the National Government for all damages to\\r\\nanimals or mankind caused by any disasters from their dangerous methods\\r\\nand products.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe can all now imagine, however, looking at the picture, Fig. 1, what\\r\\nmust be the tortures and suffering of the vaccinated heifer with one\\r\\nor two hundred festering wounds on its belly, when we recall the great\\r\\nsuffering often caused to a child with a single wound on its arm, and\\r\\nwe can also imagine what must be the effect on the entire system of the\\r\\nheifer itself--the future milk giver--in being thus saturated by the\\r\\nseptic poison from these multiple wounds, pustules or ulcers, and what\\r\\nmay be the permanent constitutional effect on the animal in developing\\r\\nor fixing in it, perhaps for life, some of our most dangerous diseases,\\r\\nsuch as tuberculosis, to which the bovine species is most subject,\\r\\nand which it has been demonstrated is chiefly transmitted to man\\r\\nthrough the milk of the cow. See 25th Report of U. S. Bureau of Animal\\r\\nIndustry, 1908, page 109. Whatever the effects on the system of the\\r\\nheifer may be, it must be obvious, however, that to be thus saturated\\r\\nby the virus of most dangerous diseases in hundreds of wounds over a\\r\\nlarge part of its body certainly cannot be good, and it is obviously\\r\\na most barbarous and revolting kind of medical art, to say the least,\\r\\nwhich thinks it must resort to such a wholesale method of diseasing\\r\\ndomestic animals first and mankind afterwards with the idea of\\r\\npromoting general health; and how any one can conceive anything more\\r\\nbarbarous or revolting and dangerous than this method, we fail to see.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow after the calf has been inoculated as described, it is removed\\r\\nfrom the table and allowed to stand on its feet in its stall securely\\r\\ntied, and carefully fed and tended and allowed to remain thus for\\r\\nabout a week, with its one or two hundred festering wounds gradually\\r\\nfilling up with ulcerative or suppurative disease matter. At this\\r\\nstage the calf is now again strapped on the table for the collection\\r\\nof this accumulated disease matter. This fresh disease matter usually\\r\\ncontains the germs of many diseases known and unknown, including human\\r\\nsmallpox and cowpox or “vaccinia” and sometimes other germs even much\\r\\nmore dangerous and fatal than smallpox. This dangerous complex disease\\r\\nmatter is now squeezed and scraped out (imagine the torture of the\\r\\nheifer as its one or two hundred wounds are successively scraped out!)\\r\\nand this horrible material is then mixed with glycerine in order to\\r\\ndilute it and make it go farther and more profitably, and also to kill\\r\\nmany dangerous germs which the complex virus is known to contain, and\\r\\nto some of which, glycerine, in a certain percentage, is fatal, but\\r\\nis not fatal to the germ of smallpox or vaccinia which it is aimed\\r\\nto preserve in more or less virile condition. In addition to this\\r\\nmixing with glycerine the virus is also subjected to a number of other\\r\\nprocesses and tests, to endeavor to free it from all the dangerous and\\r\\nfatal disease germs which it is known or is likely to contain, except\\r\\nthe smallpox germ, which is dangerous enough in itself. But it seems to\\r\\nbe impossible always to free the virus from such “foreign” germs, or to\\r\\nguarantee that it will not produce at any time some dangerous or fatal\\r\\nresult when inoculated into the body of child or adult in the operation\\r\\nof vaccination, as is proved by the two great epidemics of foot and\\r\\nmouth disease in cattle, in 1902 and 1908, and the many human deaths\\r\\noccurring after vaccinations reported every year throughout the country.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the virus has been taken from the vaccinated calves, it has been\\r\\nthe custom, in some cases, to free the diseased calves and let them\\r\\nmix with healthy herds, and in other cases the vaccinated calves have\\r\\nbeen butchered and their carcasses sold for human food! Either of\\r\\nthese methods of disposal of the diseased calves is obviously highly\\r\\ndangerous to animal and human health and life, but whether these\\r\\ndangerous practices are still used by any vaccine manufacturers or by\\r\\nany of our Health Departments having vaccine stables and laboratories\\r\\nwe do not know; but this point should be carefully investigated by the\\r\\nGovernment and these dangerous practices suppressed wherever they still\\r\\nexist.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWHAT VACCINATION REALLY IS AND HOW PUS INFECTION, LOCKJAW, AND OTHER\\r\\nDISEASES WORK TOGETHER IN VACCINATION WITH FATAL EFFECTS\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery act of cowpox vaccination consists simply in making a wound,\\r\\nscratch or puncture on the human body and then rubbing or injecting\\r\\ninto this wound a living or virulent disease virus of a more or less\\r\\ncomplex nature, usually containing the actual virus of human smallpox\\r\\ncombined with animal cowpox and always the virus of pus infection or\\r\\nsepticemia in one or more of its many forms. Dr. M. J. Rosenau, one of\\r\\nthe best authorities in the country on vaccine virus, in his recent\\r\\nwork “Preventive Medicine and Hygiene” (1914), says on pages 6 and 7:\\r\\n“Vaccine Virus always contains bacteria. There is no such thing as\\r\\naseptic virus. Staphylococci, streptococci, members of the hemorrhagic\\r\\nsepticemic group, and, in a few instances, tetanus spores and the gas\\r\\nbacillus have been found in vaccine virus.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Bulletin 12 of the U. S. Hygienic Laboratory, issued 1903, on\\r\\n“Impurities in Vaccine Virus,” Dr. Rosenau tells us that “Vaccinia is\\r\\na specific disease, the cause of which _has not been determined_. We\\r\\nare therefore _working somewhat in the dark_. We are _compelled_ to\\r\\nvaccinate our patients with a virus containing micro-organisms other\\r\\nthan those causing vaccinia.”\\r\\n\\r\\nListen to these most significant admissions by one of the highest\\r\\nauthorities on vaccine virus in the country--_working in the dark with\\r\\nan undetermined disease_! _Compelled_ to vaccinate the people with\\r\\na virus containing many different disease germs other than the one\\r\\nintended, which in itself is even yet _undetermined_ and in the _dark_!\\r\\n\\r\\nDoes this look much like known, safe, certain and scientific medicine,\\r\\nor is it merely only dangerous experiment and guesswork with deadly\\r\\ninfections on the human body?\\r\\n\\r\\nTo show that vaccination is authoritatively recognized as essentially\\r\\nequivalent to Pyæmia and Septicemia, I can cite the reports of the\\r\\nRegistrar General of England, which is the highest statistical\\r\\nauthority in the English-speaking world, which acknowledge many\\r\\nvaccination deaths every year, and these deaths are now classified\\r\\nunder a subhead of Pyæmia-Septicemia which is numbered 20 in the\\r\\nInternational List of Causes of Death, and the deaths under this\\r\\ngeneral head are divided and classified as follows: Pyæmia, No. 20A;\\r\\nSepticemia, No. 20B; Vaccinia, No. 20C. Under this latter subhead, more\\r\\ndeaths of children are recorded from vaccination almost every year than\\r\\nfrom smallpox itself! See pages 23-24. See also “Causes of Death,”\\r\\nissued by U. S. Census Bureau, 1913, page 56, No. 20, where vaccination\\r\\nis classed as a form of Purulent Infection and Septicemia.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n    FIG. 2. Vaccination on the ninth day, showing a normal,\\r\\n    ordinary or mild type. Note here that both the central sore or\\r\\n    vaccine pustule and the surrounding inflammation or “areola”\\r\\n    present, even in this mild or ordinary form, clearly a case of\\r\\n    septicemic or pus infection or blood poisoning pure and simple.\\r\\n]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Fig. 2 annexed I now give a photograph of an ordinary “successful”\\r\\nor normal vaccination on the ninth day after inoculation, showing\\r\\nthe fully developed or pustular stage of a “mild” or “safe” type of\\r\\nvaccination from which no serious harm or “complication” is supposed\\r\\nto result. It will be noted, however, that even this normal form of\\r\\nvaccination is a perfectly typical case of pus infection, septicemia\\r\\nor blood poisoning on a small or mild scale. The vaccination wound on\\r\\nthe arm, as will be seen, takes the typical form of a large irregular\\r\\npustule or small abscess about one inch in diameter, more or less,\\r\\nwith a depressed center and raised margin like a smallpox pustule, and\\r\\nthis pustule is full and tense with a collection of pus or suppurative\\r\\ndisease matter which, of course, always contains the germs of pus\\r\\ninfection, inflammation and suppuration in one or more varieties\\r\\nwhich usually include, as Dr. Rosenau has stated, the two most common\\r\\nand dangerous pus germs, known as the “staphylococcus” and the\\r\\n“streptococcus.” You will also note that around the big pustule there\\r\\nis a diffuse rash or inflammation known as the “areola” which goes\\r\\nmore or less deep in the flesh and extends more or less over the arm\\r\\naccording to the severity of the case, and is similar to or identical\\r\\nwith Erysipelas. The extent and severity of both the pustule and the\\r\\nrash vary more or less in every case, but in strong and healthy persons\\r\\nnot very susceptible to the vaccine poison the pustule and areola\\r\\nusually show no greater extent or severity than that seen in Fig. 2. I\\r\\nwill here state that this Fig. 2, as well as the following Figs. 3, 4\\r\\nand 6, are all taken by permission from “Acute Contagious Diseases,” by\\r\\nDrs. Welch and Schamberg of Philadelphia, published by Lea Brothers in\\r\\n1905, which is a high authority on pro-vaccination, and one of the most\\r\\ncomplete works on smallpox and vaccination published.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: FIG. 3. Vaccinal Ulcer.]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Fig. 3 is shown a bad case of vaccination which takes the form of\\r\\na spreading ulcer, showing a severe pus infection, being the exact\\r\\ncondition required for lockjaw to develop if its germ is already within\\r\\nthe body of the vaccinated person or if it gets into the wound in any\\r\\nway whatever from the surroundings of the person or from the vaccine\\r\\nvirus itself. See on this point my special pamphlet “Vaccination and\\r\\nLockjaw”; see also page 104 in this Supplement.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: FIG. 4. Multiple Vaccinations spread by finger-nails.]\\r\\n\\r\\nFig. 4 gives the picture of a nurse having several vaccine pustules\\r\\non the face caused by being scratched by a freshly vaccinated child,\\r\\nshowing the virulently infectious nature of vaccination as being\\r\\na septicemic or pus infection, pure and simple, which is not only\\r\\nhighly dangerous in itself but in which the terrible lockjaw and other\\r\\ndiseases find essential culture conditions for their deadly work when\\r\\nacting as double or “mixed infections.”\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n    FIG. 5. Photograph of a little English baby two months old,\\r\\n    taken after death, killed by vaccination in thirty-six days.\\r\\n    This is a very severe and frequent form of fatal vaccination\\r\\n    known as “Generalized Vaccinia,” where the vaccine sore spreads\\r\\n    all over the body in a series of big confluent pustules very\\r\\n    like confluent smallpox, being thus clearly an aggravated case\\r\\n    of pus infection and septicemia.\\r\\n]\\r\\n\\r\\nSometimes the vaccination sore spreads all over the body like a bad\\r\\ncase of confluent smallpox, as shown in Fig. 5, which shows the case\\r\\nof a little English baby two months old who was killed, according to\\r\\ndeath certificate, in thirty-six days after vaccination by this form\\r\\nof general eruption which is known as “Generalized Vaccinia.” I have\\r\\nobtained this photograph from the parents of the child through my\\r\\nLondon Office, with the death certificate, and have been informed that\\r\\nthe eruption on the covered parts of the body was even worse and more\\r\\nconfluent than that on the exposed face and arm. The name of the child\\r\\nwas Mona Stevenson, daughter of William Stevenson of Burnley, England,\\r\\nand the date of death was August 4, 1908.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n    FIG. 6. Vaccination on the tenth day, showing a severe type\\r\\n    of infection in a little child. Note wide-spread inflammation\\r\\n    over the arm at the “areola” around the vaccine pustule and the\\r\\n    bad eruption on the face which sometimes spreads all over the\\r\\n    body. This is, of course, a clear case of pus infection and\\r\\n    septicemia in which lockjaw, meningitis, pneumonia, or other\\r\\n    diseases may find their essential conditions for producing\\r\\n    their deadly work in killing the child as a direct or indirect\\r\\n    result of the vaccination and the double infection caused by it.\\r\\n]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Fig. 6, also taken from the work of Drs. Welch and Schamberg, is\\r\\nshown the photograph of a vaccinated boy, illustrating a severe form of\\r\\nvaccination which is very common in susceptible children. In this case\\r\\nthe pustule is not much different from Fig. 2, but the areola is very\\r\\nsevere and like erysipelas and has spread over a large part of the arm\\r\\nand up to the shoulder, indicating a severe infection of the system\\r\\nwith a more extensive and serious blood poisoning which is further\\r\\naggravated by a bad rash of pimples which has broken out upon the face\\r\\nand about the mouth like the first form of the eruption in smallpox.\\r\\nThis eruption may be in the form of papules, vesicles or pustules, or\\r\\nmay go through the three forms successively, as in smallpox, or abort\\r\\nat any of these stages; and these eruptions, either of the pimples\\r\\nor the areola, may sometimes extend over a large part of or even over\\r\\nthe entire body and quickly kill the child by general blood poisoning\\r\\nand exhaustion. Where the external or skin eruptions are not very\\r\\nbad, however, the child usually recovers, with or without permanent\\r\\nconstitutional injury. The worst cases of vaccinal infection are\\r\\nnot, however, those which have external skin eruptions but in which\\r\\nthere is little or no indication externally of purulent infection,\\r\\nexcept possibly at the sore itself, and in which the suppuration or\\r\\ninfection extends _inwardly_ and attacks one or more of the internal\\r\\norgans and kills by general internal suppuration known as “Pyæmia” or\\r\\n“Septicemia,” which may show itself by serious suppurations in lungs,\\r\\nbronchi, pleura, heart, brain or spine, or in the digestive or other\\r\\norgans. Thus by its very extensiveness this blood poisoning may give\\r\\nto the falsifying vaccinator ample and plausible excuse to make a\\r\\nfalse and deceptive report on the death of the vaccinated child and\\r\\nto deny and conceal the primary responsibility of vaccination for the\\r\\ninfection and death by reporting in death certificate or autopsy that\\r\\nthe child died from one or other of the terminal diseases or results\\r\\nof the vaccine infection, such as “Pneumonia,” “Broncho-Pneumonia,”\\r\\n“Pleurisy,” “Meningitis” or “Endocarditis,” or even perhaps by some\\r\\nform of intestinal inflammation and obstruction which, with a whole\\r\\nseries of other complications, may of course also result from the\\r\\nvaccinal septicemia in its general riot of infection throughout the\\r\\nwhole system. And any one of these several consequent or terminal\\r\\ndiseases can be plausibly set down by the falsifying vaccinist as the\\r\\ntrue and only cause of death, without any mention whatever of the\\r\\noriginal cause in the primary infection of the vaccination, which\\r\\nwill thus be completely ignored and brazenly denied and concealed.\\r\\nSuch a death certificate or autopsy report concealing and denying the\\r\\noriginal infection of vaccination is, sad to say, very common, and is,\\r\\nof course, just about as true and honest and acceptable as if some\\r\\nmurderer should report on his own homicidal act that the bullet which\\r\\nhe shot into the victim’s body did not really kill the victim, but\\r\\nthat it was purely the stoppage of the man’s defective heart that\\r\\nactually killed him! Or, to give another example, that it was the fatal\\r\\ninfection of lockjaw which the careless victim himself, or his careless\\r\\nnurse, allowed to get into the harmless bullet wound, that was really\\r\\nresponsible for the death and not the innocent bullet that was fired\\r\\ninto the victim’s body!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDISEASES FOUND IN OR CAUSED BY VACCINE VIRUS\\r\\n\\r\\nThe diseases which have been found or proved to exist in vaccine virus\\r\\nare as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST: Tetanus or Lockjaw, one of the most deadly and rapid in its\\r\\naction. For instances of Lockjaw germs in vaccine virus, see Journal\\r\\nMedical Research, Boston, Mass., May, 1902. See also page 105 in this\\r\\nSupplement, which shows how vaccination can cause Lockjaw, whether the\\r\\ngerms are in the virus or not.\\r\\n\\r\\nSECOND: Different forms of the germs of “Sepsis” which produce the\\r\\ndangerous and often fatal festering sores, abscesses and ulcers of\\r\\ndifferent kinds. See Bulletin 12, U. S. Hygienic Laboratory, 1903.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHIRD: Actinomycosis or “Lumpy Jaw.” This produces a terrible festering\\r\\ntumor in the bones or tissues of the head, brain, or spine, something\\r\\nlike the effects of either Cancer, Tuberculosis, or Meningitis, and may\\r\\nbe confounded therewith; and its germs have often been found in vaccine\\r\\nvirus. See Journal Medical Research, Boston, Mass., January, 1904.\\r\\n\\r\\nFOURTH: Infantile Paralysis. There is strong evidence that this\\r\\nmysterious and most fatal disease may also sometimes be caused by\\r\\nvaccination, as a direct or indirect result. See pages 145 to 162\\r\\nherein taken from Mr. Loyster’s Pamphlet. See also page 13 in the\\r\\nEnglish translation of a German work on Paralysis by Dr. Oskar Vulpius\\r\\n(Wm. Wood & Co., New York, 1912), which admits that vaccination is one\\r\\nof the causes of Infantile Paralysis.\\r\\n\\r\\nFIFTH AND SIXTH: Tuberculosis and Cancer. There has been a strong\\r\\nconviction growing for some years past among close students of\\r\\nvaccination, both within and without the medical profession, that\\r\\nthe practice of wide-spread inoculation of the population with known\\r\\nand unknown ulcerative diseases or pus infections such as found in\\r\\nvaccine virus is probably responsible for the great increase in two of\\r\\nthe worst and most fatal ulcerative diseases of modern times, viz.,\\r\\nTuberculosis and Cancer. The former causes about fourteen thousand\\r\\ndeaths every year in New York State, and the latter about eight\\r\\nthousand deaths, regularly and steadily every year, compared to which\\r\\nthe few annual deaths from smallpox are a mere bagatelle or like a\\r\\nmicroscopic flea-bite on the mortality lists.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere has long been supposed to be some relation between Cancer and\\r\\nvaccination, because the same microbial germ or form has been found\\r\\nin the virus or lesions of both diseases, and also in smallpox and\\r\\nsyphilis, known as “vaccine bodies.” See the Report of the N. Y.\\r\\nState Cancer Laboratory for 1902 and 1903, pages 10 and 78. Another\\r\\nreason for this supposed relationship is that these two of our most\\r\\nterrible and fatal diseases seem to have increased steadily since\\r\\nthe introduction of inoculation and vaccination and are now common\\r\\nin countries which are most vaccinated, such as Japan and Germany. I\\r\\nwill give a striking example of this fact here, in one instance which\\r\\nwill suffice for the present, viz.: In Japan, which is one of the most\\r\\nextensively vaccinated countries in the world, there is one of the\\r\\nhighest death-rates from Tuberculosis known, whereas in our own State\\r\\nof Utah, where all compulsory vaccination is prohibited by a State\\r\\nlaw, there is the lowest death-rate from tuberculosis in the United\\r\\nStates! See U. S. Mortality Statistics, 1913, page 28. So important has\\r\\nthis subject been getting for some years past that many investigators\\r\\nare now studying it and a prominent magazine has been considering the\\r\\npublication of a series of articles by some eminent doctors to show the\\r\\nrelationship or influence of vaccination on cancer and tuberculosis,\\r\\nwhich some of these doctors claim to have already demonstrated.\\r\\n\\r\\nCompulsory vaccination has been most rigid on the whole population in\\r\\nGermany and Japan for many years past, and it has long been known that\\r\\nGermany, like Japan, has had a very high death-rate from tuberculosis,\\r\\nwhich has been much increased since the Great War. Count von Brockdorff\\r\\nRantzau, head of the German Peace Delegation, acknowledged this grim\\r\\nfact after receiving a copy of the Peace Treaty at Versailles on May\\r\\n7, 1919, by saying: “Germany now is _the home_ of tuberculosis.” This\\r\\nsignificant fact is reported in the _New York Herald_ of May 8, 1919.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe influence of vaccination in causing, aggravating or increasing\\r\\ntuberculosis and other diseases is now well recognized by high medical\\r\\nauthorities. For example: In one of the most recent medical works it\\r\\nis distinctly admitted that vaccination influences or aggravates other\\r\\ndiseases, and that “a quiescent malady may be lighted into activity by\\r\\nvaccination.” And it is also here stated that this activating effect of\\r\\nvaccination occurs particularly in syphilis and in tuberculosis, two of\\r\\nthe most common and dangerous diseases of the human race! See Osler’s\\r\\n“Principles and Practice of Medicine,” 8th Edition, 1918, page 330.\\r\\nThis is, surely, a tremendous admission of the very dangerous effects\\r\\nof vaccination from one of the latest and highest medical authorities\\r\\nof to-day, and is sufficient, in itself, to condemn all compulsory\\r\\nvaccination.\\r\\n\\r\\nSEVENTH: Foot and Mouth Disease of Cattle. This disease is a form of\\r\\n“cowpox” and has been frequently transmitted by vaccination to both man\\r\\nand beast, and, most horrible to say, it is notorious that the great\\r\\nepidemics of this terrible cow disease in 1902 and 1908 were caused by\\r\\nthe manufacture of vaccine virus, and the last or greatest of these\\r\\nepidemics, of 1914 and 1915, is believed also to be due to vaccination,\\r\\nalthough not yet clearly proved. See Year Book of U. S. Department of\\r\\nAgriculture for 1914, page 20. See also reports of U. S. Bureau of\\r\\nAnimal Industry for 1902 and 1908. These several epidemics have caused\\r\\nthe slaughter of hundreds of thousands of cattle and other domestic\\r\\nanimals, at a loss of many millions of dollars to the Government and\\r\\npeople of the United States.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: FIG. 7. Cow suffering from Foot and Mouth Disease caused\\r\\nby Vaccination.]\\r\\n\\r\\nFig. 7 shows a cow suffering with foot and mouth disease, which is\\r\\na kind of virulent cowpox, very infectious and contagious, conveyed\\r\\nby vaccination, and transmissible to man and beast. Note the badly\\r\\nulcerated and dribbling mouth of the cow. Ulcerations also affect\\r\\nthe feet, and eruptions of vesicles break out in successive crops on\\r\\ndifferent parts of the body, particularly on teats and udder, on lips\\r\\nand nostrils, and in the mouth and throat. This picture is taken from\\r\\nthe Report of the U. S. Bureau of Animal Industry for 1902, on the bad\\r\\nepidemic in the New England States in that year, where, in several\\r\\ninstances, this dangerous cow disease was conveyed to human subjects\\r\\nthrough vaccination, resulting in horrible eruptions and agonizing\\r\\ndeath, as I will show further on at pages 110 and 112.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: FIG. 8. Oxen with Foot and Mouth Disease caused by\\r\\nVaccination.]\\r\\n\\r\\nFig. 8 is taken from the same Report for 1902 previously mentioned and\\r\\nshows a yoke of oxen suffering with the foot and mouth disease and\\r\\nready to be killed and buried to suppress the infection. Note the sore\\r\\nand gaping mouths of the oxen and their sore and swollen feet. They are\\r\\nshown standing in the bottom of a deep trench into which they have been\\r\\ndriven and where they will be shot; their bodies will then be covered\\r\\nwith quicklime and finally buried under six feet of earth to destroy\\r\\nthe infection.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: FIG. 8½.

Compare this eruption with the human\\r\\neruptions in Figs. 3, 4, 5, 11, 12 and 13. This illustration is taken\\r\\nfrom Farmers’ Bulletin No. 666, on the foot and mouth disease, issued\\r\\nby the U. S. Department of Agriculture, 1915. Fig. 9 shows the awful\\r\\n“Vaccine Holocaust.” See page 96.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: FIG. 9. The Vaccine Holocaust. Look at this picture and\\r\\nread next page.]\\r\\n\\r\\n    THE VACCINE HOLOCAUST\\r\\n\\r\\n    WHOLESALE INFECTION, SLAUGHTER AND SACRIFICE OF CATTLE CAUSED\\r\\n    BY VACCINATION\\r\\n\\r\\n    _From Pamphlet “Open Your Eyes” by Chas. M. Higgins--1912_\\r\\n\\r\\n    The photograph on preceding page is taken from the Report of\\r\\n    the U. S. Bureau of Animal Industry for 1902 on the great\\r\\n    epidemic of Cattle Plague, or Foot and Mouth Disease, in\\r\\n    Massachusetts in 1902, caused by vaccine virus, which cost\\r\\n    the U. S. Government $130,000 to suppress and caused the\\r\\n    slaughter of 4316 animals. In this impressive picture you\\r\\n    will note the bodies of hundreds of cattle resting on a pile\\r\\n    of fire-wood in a trench on the snow covered ground ready for\\r\\n    burning to destroy the infection caused by the vaccine virus.\\r\\n    Look carefully, as the picture is much reduced, and you will\\r\\n    see a man at the left in the trench setting fire to the pile.\\r\\n    Note the horns, heads, and hoofs of the cattle bristling from\\r\\n    all sides of the funeral pile. Soon you will see the smoke of\\r\\n    sacrifice rise from these victims of vaccination on the altar\\r\\n    of Medical Barbarism--a Holocaust to the Demon Vaccine!\\r\\n\\r\\n    In 1908 there was a second epidemic of the same disease which\\r\\n    raged in several States, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Maryland\\r\\n    and New York, caused by the vaccine virus used by two of the\\r\\n    largest manufacturers of vaccine virus in the United States.\\r\\n    (See Report of the U. S. Bureau of Animal Industry for 1908.)\\r\\n    In this second epidemic 3636 animals were slaughtered at a cost\\r\\n    to the U. S. Government of $300,000. In both epidemics there\\r\\n    occurred outbreaks of similar disease among vaccinated persons\\r\\n    in the infected States, from which many deaths resulted. What\\r\\n    do you now think of any medical scheme for the alleged benefit\\r\\n    of “public health” which is capable of causing such disasters\\r\\n    to animal and human life as this peculiar and extraordinary\\r\\n    scheme of bovine vaccination? Do you think, Mr. President, that\\r\\n    any medical device capable of causing such disasters should\\r\\n    be made compulsory by law, in our Army or Navy, on our public\\r\\n    school children or on any one else in any shape or form? And\\r\\n    do you not think that all compulsion should be now abolished\\r\\n    and Medical Freedom from inflicted disease established as an\\r\\n    absolute American and Hygienic Right?\\r\\n\\r\\nFig. 10 shows a map of the second epidemic of foot and mouth disease\\r\\nin 1908, taken from the Report of the U. S. Bureau of Animal Industry\\r\\nfor 1908. The shaded counties in the four States of Michigan, New\\r\\nYork, Pennsylvania and Maryland show where the epidemic of that year\\r\\nspread and how it originated and travelled. This epidemic was caused\\r\\nby manufacturers of vaccine virus and originated from the virus\\r\\nof two large American manufacturers, one in Detroit, the other in\\r\\nPhiladelphia. This strain of virus is said to have come originally from\\r\\nJapan, the much-vaccinated country, and contained the infection of foot\\r\\nand mouth disease, and it was used apparently for years without any\\r\\nknowledge that it carried this dangerous disease, which was probably\\r\\nconveyed to many vaccinated children and adults in that time with\\r\\na horrible eruptive effect in many cases,--how many will never be\\r\\nknown. This infection of the vaccine virus was not known or discovered\\r\\nuntil 1908 because the Philadelphia company killed their calves after\\r\\ngetting the virus from them and thus prevented the vaccinated calves\\r\\nfrom mixing with and infecting healthy cattle, but confined the\\r\\ninfection to vaccinated human beings. In 1908, however, the Detroit\\r\\ncompany got some of this “seed virus” from the Philadelphia company to\\r\\n“strengthen” their product. The Detroit method was not to finally kill\\r\\nthe vaccinated calves, but to hire unvaccinated calves from farmers or\\r\\nstock dealers and after they were infected, and the virus taken from\\r\\nthem, to return the calves to the farmers or stockmen, where they thus\\r\\nmixed with healthy cattle which were afterwards shipped to different\\r\\nStates and thus spread the great plague of foot and mouth disease in\\r\\nthat year, as shown by the official map annexed and by the official\\r\\nreports cited below.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: FIG. 10. Map of Epidemic of 1908 caused by Vaccine\\r\\nVirus.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOFFICIAL REPORTS PROVING VACCINATION TO BE THE CAUSE OF FOOT AND MOUTH\\r\\nDISEASE\\r\\n\\r\\nFor expert proof that vaccination is responsible for epidemics of Foot\\r\\nand Mouth Disease, see the annual reports of the U. S. Bureau of Animal\\r\\nIndustry, already cited, for 1902 and 1908, and also the Year Book\\r\\nof the U. S. Department of Agriculture for 1914, page 21. See also\\r\\nFarmers’ Bulletin No. 666, issued by the Department of Agriculture. See\\r\\nparticularly the first official report on the epidemics of Foot and\\r\\nMouth Disease in 1902 and 1908, issued by the U. S. Bureau of Animal\\r\\nIndustry. This first report is not now in print but is on record in the\\r\\nBureau and it was first given to the press and released for publication\\r\\non May 17, 1909; and from a copy of this report obtained from the said\\r\\nBureau, I now give the following extracts which will clearly show that\\r\\nit was the vaccine virus used by two of our largest manufacturers\\r\\nof virus in the United States that was responsible for causing the\\r\\nepidemic of foot and mouth disease in 1908, and was also probably the\\r\\ncause of the previous epidemic of the same disease in 1902 and 1903.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“COPY OF STATEMENT GIVEN TO THE PRESS BY THE BUREAU OF ANIMAL INDUSTRY,\\r\\nU. S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE, RELEASED FOR PUBLICATION, MAY 17, 1909\\r\\n\\r\\n    “ORIGIN OF THE RECENT OUTBREAK OF FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE\\r\\n\\r\\n    “The recent outbreak of foot and mouth disease in Michigan,\\r\\n    New York, Pennsylvania and Maryland started from calves used\\r\\n    in the propagation of smallpox vaccine virus which had been\\r\\n    contaminated with the virus of foot and mouth disease, and the\\r\\n    contaminated strain of vaccine originally came from a foreign\\r\\n    country.\\r\\n\\r\\n    “The main facts regarding the outbreak ... are as follows:\\r\\n    The H. K. Mulford Company of Glen Olden, Pa., imported\\r\\n    certain smallpox vaccine virus which was contaminated with\\r\\n    the infection of foot and mouth disease. In May, 1908, some\\r\\n    vaccine of this strain was procured by Parke, Davis & Co. of\\r\\n    Detroit. Calves used by the latter firm in propagating vaccine\\r\\n    were sent, October 16, to the Detroit stock yards and thence\\r\\n    on the same day to a farm near Detroit. On October 20, three\\r\\n    carloads of cattle from points in Michigan reached the Detroit\\r\\n    stock yards and were put into the pens that had been occupied\\r\\n    by the vaccine calves four days previously. Some were sold\\r\\n    for slaughter at Detroit, while the remainder were shipped to\\r\\n    Buffalo and some were reshipped to Danville and Watsontown,\\r\\n    Pa., where the disease was first observed some days later. The\\r\\n    disease spread to various places in Pennsylvania and New York\\r\\n    and to one locality in Maryland. [See Map, page 98.]\\r\\n\\r\\n    “Three separate series of experiments were made by Doctors\\r\\n    Mohler and Rosenau. Young cattle and sheep were inoculated with\\r\\n    vaccine virus obtained from both firms. Foot and mouth disease\\r\\n    was produced in experimental animals by the use of vaccine of\\r\\n    the same strain obtained from both sources, while other strains\\r\\n    of vaccine tested gave negative results. The disease was also\\r\\n    transmitted from one animal to another through several series,\\r\\n    in two instances by natural modes of infection.\\r\\n\\r\\n    “The investigation also indicates that the outbreaks of foot\\r\\n    and mouth disease in New England in 1902-3 were probably due\\r\\n    to contaminated vaccine of Japanese origin from the Mulford\\r\\n    Company....\\r\\n\\r\\n    “The fact that the infection was present in the vaccine virus\\r\\n    of the Mulford Company for so long a period, but was not\\r\\n    transmitted to outside cattle, was doubtless due to this firm’s\\r\\n    practice of killing its calves after taking the vaccine virus.\\r\\n    Parke, Davis & Co., on the other hand, rented their calves and\\r\\n    placed them again on the market a short time after the vaccine\\r\\n    material was taken. In this way the disease spread from the\\r\\n    vaccine stables of Parke, Davis & Co., but not from those of\\r\\n    the Mulford Company, although it was the vaccine virus from the\\r\\n    latter establishment that infected the former’s cattle....\\r\\n\\r\\n    “As soon as the facts regarding the contamination of vaccine\\r\\n    became known, the licenses of the two firms involved were\\r\\n    at once suspended, all the suspected vaccine virus on hand\\r\\n    was destroyed and that upon the market withdrawn, and other\\r\\n    measures of a radical nature were taken. The report commends\\r\\n    the intelligent and prompt coöperation of the Mulford Company\\r\\n    and Parke, Davis & Co. in accomplishing this end. After an\\r\\n    examination of every strain of vaccine upon the market, it is\\r\\n    stated that there is now (1909) upon the market no vaccine\\r\\n    contaminated with the virus of foot and mouth disease.\\r\\n    Regulations have been formulated with a view to preventing\\r\\n    hereafter the propagation of contaminated vaccine virus. No\\r\\n    instance of the transmission of foot and mouth disease to man\\r\\n    through vaccine virus has been recorded, and it is considered\\r\\n    doubtful, in view of the tests made, if it is possible to\\r\\n    reproduce the disease in him by the cutaneous inoculation\\r\\n    commonly used in the process of vaccination.”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAN OFFICIAL DOUBT DISPROVED\\r\\n\\r\\nIt will be noted that in the official report just quoted there is no\\r\\nquestion of the responsibility of vaccine virus for causing the deadly\\r\\nplague of foot and mouth disease in cattle and other domestic animals\\r\\nand that two or more extensive and deadly epidemics in animals have\\r\\nbeen thus caused by the virus of certain manufacturers, involving\\r\\nthe destruction of thousands of animals and the loss of millions of\\r\\ndollars to the Government and people of the United States! It will also\\r\\nbe noted, however, that at the end of this report there is a guarded\\r\\nor tentative statement that no instance of the transmission of foot\\r\\nand mouth disease to human subjects by vaccination is known or “has\\r\\nbeen recorded”; and that there is some doubt that this disease can be\\r\\nconveyed to man by skin inoculation only, as in vaccination, although\\r\\nit is clear that it can be and has been surely conveyed to domestic\\r\\nanimals by such inoculation! It is admitted in later reports that the\\r\\ndisease can be conveyed to animals or man by ordinary skin inoculation\\r\\nor scarification provided some blood is drawn in the operation, which\\r\\nis, of course, a common occurrence in ordinary vaccination. This rather\\r\\ndoubtful statement as to infection in man by ordinary vaccination I\\r\\nwill therefore prove to be an evident error and will give, further on,\\r\\nthe most convincing proof that foot and mouth disease--or what is in\\r\\nevery way equivalent to and identical with it--is frequently conveyed\\r\\nto mankind by vaccination, with fatal effect!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA BIG PRICE TO PAY FOR VACCINATION\\r\\n\\r\\nTo suppress the epidemic of 1902, as already shown, 4,316 animals were\\r\\nslaughtered by the U. S. Government at a cost of $130,000; and in the\\r\\nepidemic of 1908 the Government slaughtered 3,636 animals at a cost of\\r\\n$300,000. The last or recent epidemic, which has been the worst of all,\\r\\nextended from 1914 to 1916, invaded twenty-three States and involved\\r\\nthe destruction of 172,222 animals, chiefly swine, cattle and sheep, in\\r\\nthe order stated. The cost of this destruction amounted to a loss of\\r\\nover nine millions of dollars, half of which was paid by the National\\r\\nGovernment and half by the States! See the report of the Chief of the\\r\\nU. S. Bureau of Animal Industry for 1916. This is surely a big price\\r\\nto pay for vaccination, which was most probably the cause of this last\\r\\nand greatest epidemic, as it was proved to be the cause of the previous\\r\\nepidemics of 1908 and 1902! And at this point it should be remembered\\r\\nthat this last epidemic of 1914 to 1916 originated in the same State of\\r\\nMichigan where one of the largest vaccine factories in the country is\\r\\nlocated and from which factory the epidemic of 1908 was proved to have\\r\\noriginated!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEPIDEMICS OF SMALLPOX PROBABLY CAUSED BY VACCINATION AND FOOT AND MOUTH\\r\\nDISEASE\\r\\n\\r\\nAn interesting and significant fact in relation to the epidemic of\\r\\n1908 is that the lake counties of New York where the foot and mouth\\r\\ndisease prevailed in 1908, as shown on the map in Fig. 10, are the same\\r\\ncounties where the greatest outbreaks of smallpox occurred in 1913 and\\r\\n1914, and may possibly have had some relation to the previous epidemic\\r\\nof virulent cowpox or foot and mouth disease in 1908 and to the last\\r\\nepidemic of this disease in 1914 to 1916. This point seems to be worthy\\r\\nof careful investigation, to say the least, because I am convinced\\r\\nthat so-called “Foot and Mouth Disease” may be really a virulent form\\r\\nof “Cowpox” or a mongrel form of smallpox and may sometimes convey\\r\\nto mankind what may actually be, or be mistaken for, a mild form of\\r\\nsmallpox, such as prevailed in the lake counties of New York in 1914,\\r\\nincluding the City of Niagara Falls.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCATTLE EPIDEMICS COMMON IN VACCINATED COUNTRIES\\r\\n\\r\\nNow these epidemics of foot and mouth disease in cattle seem to be no\\r\\nuncommon thing, and, what is very significant, they seem to be very\\r\\ncommon, severe, and almost constant in countries where vaccination\\r\\nis very extensive and rigid, such as in Germany and also in Japan,\\r\\nwhere German ideas have been copied and where, of course, the cattle\\r\\nare extensively diseased to produce this vile disease stuff, known\\r\\nas vaccine virus; and it must be here noted that it was from much\\r\\nvaccinated Japan that the seed virus came which caused our great\\r\\nepidemics of 1902 and 1908.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Report of the U. S. Department of Agriculture for 1908, page 381,\\r\\nshows that _in one year_, in Germany alone, over _800,000 cattle\\r\\nand other animals_ were infected by Foot and Mouth Disease. And it\\r\\nseems probable that this extensive infection of cattle may have come\\r\\noriginally from the general and wide-spread vaccination used in Germany.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow so far as we know the parties responsible for causing the great\\r\\ndamage in our two great epidemics of foot and mouth disease have as yet\\r\\nmade no legal recompense to the National or State Governments, or to\\r\\nthe private individuals aggrieved, for which damage they would appear\\r\\nto be clearly liable.\\r\\n\\r\\nConsider for a moment the audacious recklessness and negligence\\r\\nin infecting cattle in hundreds of wounds on the body with a most\\r\\ninfectious disease, or combination of diseases, commonly and falsely\\r\\nrepresented as harmless, and afterwards turning these dangerously\\r\\ninfected animals loose among healthy herds! But this is only one of\\r\\nthe audacious acts and dangerous results against public right, health,\\r\\nand safety occurring constantly from the deadly medical barbarism\\r\\nof compulsory vaccination, which the Government would do well to\\r\\ninvestigate and correct immediately. And the best way to begin this\\r\\ncorrection is to ABOLISH ALL COMPULSORY VACCINATION.\\r\\n\\r\\nI will show further on how foot and mouth disease is frequently\\r\\nconveyed to mankind by vaccination, with awful and fatal effects, but\\r\\nin the meantime I will first show how deaths from lockjaw are one of\\r\\nthe most common and fatal results of vaccination.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHOW LOCKJAW IS CAUSED BY VACCINATION AND HOW THIS TRUTH IS DENIED AND\\r\\nCONCEALED BY VACCINATORS\\r\\n\\r\\nThis dreadful and most fatal disease known as “Tetanus” or Lockjaw\\r\\nis such a common result of vaccination, and the consequential and\\r\\nresponsible relation of vaccination thereto is so shamefully denied and\\r\\nconcealed by vaccinators, that a special chapter seems to be necessary\\r\\nhere to give the real truth on this important point.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn my previous pamphlet “Vaccination and Lockjaw” I have treated\\r\\nthis subject exhaustively and now refer thereto for full facts and\\r\\nauthorities, but I will give an outline of the subject here which will\\r\\ncover the main facts in the case.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the most common and false defences of the vaccinators on this\\r\\npoint is the shameful fallacy and falsehood that if the lockjaw\\r\\ngerms are not found in the virus itself, therefore vaccination with\\r\\nthis virus cannot cause lockjaw in the vaccinated person or be held\\r\\nresponsible for it. This is, substantially, the logic or implication\\r\\nin one of our latest Government reports on this subject by Dr. J. F.\\r\\nAnderson, entitled “Post Vaccination Tetanus,” which title means in\\r\\nplain English, _Lockjaw after Vaccination_, published in the U. S.\\r\\nHealth Reports of July 16, 1915.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this report the author, who is an expert on vaccines, practically\\r\\nexcuses vaccination for all blame for lockjaw deaths where the lockjaw\\r\\ngerms do not exist, or cannot be proved to exist in the vaccine virus\\r\\nitself!... After making this half truthful and misleading report\\r\\nfavorable to vaccination, the author, according to the statement of a\\r\\nWashington newspaper, resigned from the employ of the U. S. Government\\r\\nat a salary reported as $4,500 per year and entered the employ of one\\r\\nof the biggest manufacturers of vaccine virus and serums in the country\\r\\nat the alleged enormous salary of $25,000 per year!\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a more truthful and accurate report showing how lockjaw germs are\\r\\nwidely diffused and how they absolutely depend on a pus infection, like\\r\\nthe vaccination sore, or its equivalent, for their “activation” and\\r\\nfatal effects, as now explained here, see Studies of Dr. Francis, in\\r\\nBulletin No. 95, U. S. Hygienic Laboratory, August, 1914.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLOCKJAW MAY BE CAUSED BY VACCINATION WHETHER THE GERMS ARE IN THE VIRUS\\r\\nOR NOT\\r\\n\\r\\nThe real truth in this matter is, therefore, that there are at least\\r\\nfour distinct ways in which vaccination can cause death from lockjaw:\\r\\n\\r\\n_First_: The lockjaw germs may be in the virus itself and be inoculated\\r\\ndirectly into the vaccination wound at the moment of vaccination.\\r\\nAnd, despite Dr. Anderson’s negative tests, the possibility of this\\r\\ndirect infection can exist at any time, as admitted by some of our\\r\\nbest authorities, already quoted, on account of the many ways in which\\r\\nthe infection can enter the virus, from the vaccinated calf itself and\\r\\notherwise, and also because its presence cannot always be proved by\\r\\ntests, although known to be in the virus. The lockjaw germ normally\\r\\ndwells in and issues from the digestive organs of domestic animals and\\r\\nis therefore found in manure and garden soil and on the hide and hair\\r\\nof animals and hence may be in the body of the vaccinated calf itself\\r\\nfrom which the virus is produced!\\r\\n\\r\\n_Second_: The lockjaw germ, which is widely distributed in some\\r\\nlocalities, may exist on the person of the vaccinator or the vaccinated\\r\\nat the time of vaccination and be then introduced into the wound with\\r\\nthe virus, and the two infections may thus develop together, the pus\\r\\ninfection in the wound being necessary to “activate” the lockjaw germs\\r\\nas already shown.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Third_: The lockjaw germ may enter the vaccination wound and grow in\\r\\nits pus secretion at any time during its suppurating stage by chance\\r\\nscratching, abrasion or absorption, and thus develop its awful toxin\\r\\nwith fatal effect on the vaccinated victim.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Fourth_: The lockjaw germ may already exist within the body when the\\r\\nvaccination is performed, and is known to frequently exist as a natural\\r\\ntenant or denizen of the healthy human body, in nearly one-quarter of\\r\\nthe human race! This is also the case with several other disease germs.\\r\\nIn such cases the indwelling lockjaw germ will remain entirely inert,\\r\\ndormant and harmless in the body unless some condition necessary to\\r\\nits “activation” or growth is presented, such as that of a suppurating\\r\\nsore, ulcer, abscess or wound, anywhere within or upon the body, the\\r\\npus-infected or suppurating vaccination sore being, of course, the\\r\\nideal condition for the activation and growth of the fatal lockjaw\\r\\ninfection, as already shown; and this is probably the most common and\\r\\ndangerous way in which vaccination can cause death from lockjaw and\\r\\nother diseases, and the greatest care in the preparation of the virus\\r\\nitself cannot avoid this danger!\\r\\n\\r\\nIt will therefore be seen that in every one of these instances the\\r\\nvaccination wound or sore itself is the essential cause or condition of\\r\\nthe lockjaw infection, which could not or would not exist without this\\r\\ncondition, or its equivalent, and hence it is nothing but a dastardly\\r\\nevasion and perversion of medical truth and honesty to try to show\\r\\nthat, because the lockjaw germ is not in the virus at the moment of\\r\\nvaccination, or that it gets into the wound afterwards through some\\r\\nnatural chance or condition to which the human body is constantly\\r\\nsubjected, therefore the act of vaccination is not responsible for the\\r\\nresulting death from lockjaw.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“ASSASSINATION OF THE BLOOD” MUST BE STOPPED\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is time, therefore, that this outrageously dishonest medical\\r\\nquibble as to the exact source of infection in vaccinal lockjaw was\\r\\nsilenced once for all. What difference does it make to the victim\\r\\nof this terribly fatal disease whether the lockjaw germ was in the\\r\\nvirus itself or in or on the victim’s own body, when in either case\\r\\nthe act of vaccination, _per se_ and _ab initio_, is the cause of\\r\\nthe infection becoming active and fatal in the human body? A logic\\r\\nwhich would contend otherwise would free the assassins of Presidents\\r\\nGarfield and McKinley from the charge of murder because, forsooth,\\r\\nthe fatal septic infection which killed these victims was not on the\\r\\nmurderous bullets when they were fired into their bodies, but entered\\r\\nthe wounds afterwards through their own carelessness! This is exactly\\r\\nthe false and murderous logic that is constantly used by our well-paid\\r\\nprofessional apologists for vaccination and by their abject dupes, our\\r\\nbefooled editors, who brazenly or ignorantly use it in defense of this\\r\\ngross medical malpractice of forcing a most dangerous form of disease\\r\\nand blood infection on healthy and helpless children and adults, which\\r\\na great English doctor, James J. Garth Wilkinson, so truly calls the\\r\\n“Assassination of the Blood” in the following glowing words, written\\r\\nmany years ago, but which convey a stinging rebuke to men of his own\\r\\ngreat profession in this matter to-day: “This is blood assassination,\\r\\nand like a murderer’s life. The point, however, here is that this\\r\\namazing act is the homicidal insanity of a whole profession.” See “On\\r\\nHuman Science, Good and Evil,” Lippincott, Phila., 1876, page 35.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nVACCINATION AND LOCKJAW MORE “RISKY” AND DEADLY THAN SMALLPOX\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a matter of cold fact, therefore, these “Assassins of the Blood,”\\r\\nvaccination and lockjaw, offer a far greater risk and danger to human\\r\\nhealth and life than natural smallpox itself, and if we should fear\\r\\nanything for ourselves or our children it should be vaccination and\\r\\nlockjaw instead of smallpox, of which we stand in far less danger than\\r\\nof being struck by lightning, whereas lockjaw is a steady and constant\\r\\ndanger thirty times greater than smallpox, as the following comparative\\r\\nlist of deaths from Smallpox, Lightning and Lockjaw in the State of\\r\\nNew York will readily show. This list is taken from the reports of our\\r\\nState Department of Health for the seven years from 1910 to 1916, as\\r\\nfollows:\\r\\n\\r\\n           Smallpox   Lightning    Lockjaw\\r\\n\\r\\n  1910      7 deaths   16 deaths   94 deaths\\r\\n  1911      3   ”      30   ”     114   ”\\r\\n  1912      4   ”      21   ”      97   ”\\r\\n  1913      1   ”      13   ”     111   ”\\r\\n  1914      3   ”      33   ”     115   ”\\r\\n  1915      0   ”      18   ”      90   ”\\r\\n  1916      3   ”      19   ”      69   ”\\r\\n           --          --         ---\\r\\n  Totals   21         150         690\\r\\n\\r\\nIt will be noted that the ordinary danger from smallpox is so actually\\r\\nand relatively insignificant here that it is regularly six to eight\\r\\ntimes less than that of being struck by lightning, and that the danger\\r\\nfrom lockjaw of all kinds is so great and constant that it is about\\r\\nthirty times greater than that from smallpox, whereas vaccinal lockjaw,\\r\\nwhich is about ten per cent. of all lockjaw deaths, is at least three\\r\\ntimes more dangerous by actual frequency of occurrence than natural\\r\\nsmallpox!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE HORROR OF HORRORS, CATTLE PLAGUE OR FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE, CAUSED\\r\\nIN MANKIND BY VACCINATION. MEDICAL IGNORANCE ON THIS POINT SCORED\\r\\n\\r\\nI have already exposed the deadly epidemics of virulent cowpox or foot\\r\\nand mouth disease in cattle and domestic animals caused by vaccination.\\r\\nI now come to expose one of the most shocking results of vaccination\\r\\nyet disclosed, viz.: the transmission of this horrible cow disease to\\r\\nthe human subject. This disease, as a vaccinal result, in mankind, is\\r\\nmuch more common and fatal than has been generally supposed, and every\\r\\neffort seems to have been made by our vaccinators and health officers\\r\\nto deny and conceal the facts in this matter from the public, which\\r\\nis easily accomplished because of the great general ignorance of all\\r\\nvaccination matters not only by the mass of the people but by the mass\\r\\nof the medical profession itself. For example, the medical profession\\r\\ndoes not seem to be yet aware of the fact that the severe skin and\\r\\ngeneral disease called “Pemphigus” in man is identical with foot\\r\\nand mouth disease in cattle, nor do they seem to be generally aware\\r\\nof the fact that “Pemphigus” is frequently conveyed by “Cowpox” or\\r\\nvaccination, and they seem to be equally ignorant of the notorious fact\\r\\nthat certain makes of vaccine virus had been infected for years with\\r\\nfoot and mouth disease, and conveyed this disease in epidemic and fatal\\r\\nform to animals and mankind. Neither do they seem to be aware of the\\r\\nfact that experience now indicates that Foot and Mouth disease may be\\r\\nultimately proved to be only a virulent form of “Cowpox” or a mongrel\\r\\nform of Smallpox to which ordinary Cowpox or “Vaccinia” may degenerate\\r\\nat any time like a mild domestic dog suddenly changing, in an attack of\\r\\nRabies, to a mad, dangerous, and deadly distributor of disease.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo show that the close relation, if not the identity, of vaccination\\r\\nwith Smallpox and Foot and Mouth Disease is now recognized by\\r\\nspecial students of this subject, I may here quote from the speech\\r\\nof Senator Money of Mississippi in the U. S. Senate, February 25,\\r\\n1909, as reported in the _Congressional Record_, in the debate on the\\r\\nAgricultural Appropriation Bill, concerning the epidemic of Foot and\\r\\nMouth Disease in 1908, as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n    “This is an important question with respect to cattle, but\\r\\n    it is very much more important to the human beings of this\\r\\n    country. These vaccine points are the things with which we\\r\\n    vaccinate the children of this country against smallpox. It has\\r\\n    been found that it sometimes makes them immune from smallpox,\\r\\n    but gives them the foot and mouth disease, which is just about\\r\\n    as bad.\\r\\n\\r\\n    “The trouble about the matter is that we can not in the United\\r\\n    States produce vaccine for any length of time, for the reason\\r\\n    that this is not a pox country. It is not the home of the\\r\\n    disease. We have to import it from abroad, and consequently\\r\\n    the vaccine points that are produced upon the spot which is the\\r\\n    habitat of this particular disease are the only ones that will\\r\\n    retain the virus in sufficient strength to enable it to render\\r\\n    the human being vaccinated immune from smallpox. Consequently\\r\\n    we can not, as has been expected by a great many people, raise\\r\\n    our own vaccine points, because they lose their power for\\r\\n    immunity against smallpox. We now run the constant danger that\\r\\n    has been manifested very unpleasantly in several localities\\r\\n    of vaccinating children and grown people with these imported\\r\\n    vaccine points and communicating the foot and mouth disease,\\r\\n    which is just about as bad as the smallpox.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWe will now show in the following pages and illustrations how Foot and\\r\\nMouth Disease is conveyed to mankind in vaccination and that it is not\\r\\nonly as bad as smallpox, as Senator Money has stated, but much worse.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.

Compare with Figs. 2, 4 and 6.\\r\\n]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were ten cases of this kind treated at the Boston City Hospital\\r\\nin January, 1902, by Dr. James S. Howe, who read a report of the cases\\r\\nbefore a meeting of the American Dermatological Association in Boston\\r\\nin September, 1902, which was afterwards published in the Journal of\\r\\nCutaneous Diseases for January and June, 1903, from which I quote\\r\\nbelow. Dr. Howe exhibited photographs of these cases at the meeting\\r\\nreferred to, which also appeared in said Journal here quoted, copies of\\r\\nsome of which are now shown in Figs. 11 and 12.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese cases and the published report of them are also cited in the\\r\\nmedical work before quoted, “Acute Contagious Diseases,” on page 82\\r\\ntherein, so that there is full medical authority for their citation\\r\\nhere and ample proof of their nature and origin as being due to\\r\\nvaccination.\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Howe reported that out of the ten cases of this kind treated in\\r\\nthe hospital six were fatal, thus showing the deadly nature of this\\r\\nvaccinal disease, which greatly exceeds the average or worst types of\\r\\nsmallpox! In Dr. Howe’s report of these cases, at the meeting referred\\r\\nto, he stated as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n    “Early in January of the present year [1902], while the wave\\r\\n    of vaccination was at its full height [during a smallpox\\r\\n    epidemic], there were received in the Boston City Hospital for\\r\\n    treatment, a remarkable series of cases of bullous dermatitis.\\r\\n    All of these cases appeared in persons recently vaccinated....\\r\\n    The longest duration of the disease in any one case was sixteen\\r\\n    weeks, followed by recovery, and the shortest was one week,\\r\\n    followed by death. The skin lesions began to appear in these\\r\\n    cases in an average of five weeks after vaccination, sixteen\\r\\n    weeks having elapsed in one case, the longest, and three weeks\\r\\n    in one case, the shortest.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIt may be proper to state just here that the “skin lesions” and other\\r\\neruptions in these human cases were substantially or identically\\r\\nthe same as in the cattle affected with foot and mouth disease in\\r\\nthe epidemic of 1902 and 1908 previously described, these eruptions\\r\\nbeing of the _same kind_ and in the _same locations_; that is, the\\r\\neruptions consisted of numerous vesicles of various sizes, from the\\r\\nsize of a pea to that of a dime, half dollar and dollar, and these\\r\\nvesicles broke out all over the body as shown in Figs. 11 and 12,\\r\\nbut particularly on feet and hands, lips and nostrils and inside the\\r\\nmouth and throat, and in fact on and in all interior parts of the\\r\\nbody covered by mucous membrane, as well as on the external skin, and\\r\\nsometimes in internal organs. These vesicles would sometimes change to\\r\\npustules or semi-pustules as shown in Fig. 12, and these would spread\\r\\nand run together into large confluent vesicles or blisters, as shown\\r\\nin Fig. 11, and these blisters would then rupture, collapse, drain\\r\\nand excoriate, leaving great raw sores like terrible scalds or burns,\\r\\nas shown in the big black and gray blotches in Fig. 11, thus causing\\r\\ngreat suffering and agony in this most pitiable victim of vaccination.\\r\\nThe victim in Fig. 11 was a woman forty years old, who died ten hours\\r\\nafter admission to the hospital and six weeks after vaccination, and in\\r\\nwhom the eruptions first appeared three weeks after vaccination. Fig.\\r\\n12 shows the eruptions in their early or mid stage, and Fig. 11 shows\\r\\nthem in their later or final stage. And it must be here understood that\\r\\nthese eruptions appear in successive crops, as in the cattle disease,\\r\\none crop disappearing and healing, to be followed by another crop in a\\r\\nfew days, and these ten cases of Dr. Howe had from two or three to nine\\r\\nsuccessive eruptions before death or recovery! The case shown in Fig.\\r\\n12 is that of a man twenty-one years old in whom the first eruption\\r\\nappeared four and a half weeks after vaccination and who had _nine\\r\\nsuccessive eruptions_ before he finally recovered and was discharged\\r\\nfrom the hospital about five months after vaccination!\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Howe gave it as his opinion that the disease in these ten cases\\r\\nwas caused by some infection in the vaccine virus at the time of\\r\\nvaccination, and a majority of the doctors present at the meeting\\r\\nseemed to agree with him and gave several instances where similar cases\\r\\nhappened in their own practice, thus showing that this disease is\\r\\nreally a common result of vaccination. One of the doctors then present,\\r\\nLouis H. Duhring of Philadelphia, an expert on skin diseases, said:\\r\\n\\r\\n    “We must grant, I think, in the light of the history of these\\r\\n    cases and what we know of other similar cases, that they are\\r\\n    the direct or indirect result of vaccination. While we hear a\\r\\n    good deal, _pro_ and _con_, about vaccination, of its injurious\\r\\n    results on the part of those who are opposed to it, and of\\r\\n    its value on the part of those who favor it, I have always\\r\\n    felt that those who are opposed to vaccination, or, rather,\\r\\n    those who have brought forward the possible ill effects of\\r\\n    vaccination, did not in some instances have a fair hearing.\\r\\n    I, myself, have seen cases at least similar to the ones\\r\\n    reported by Dr. Howe, as well as others, where the local and\\r\\n    constitutional manifestations were undoubtedly the result of\\r\\n    vaccination.”\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Howe seemed to be somewhat mystified by the disease and at a loss\\r\\nfor the best or most proper technical name for it, and on this head he\\r\\nstated as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n    “On the other hand, it might seem more proper to call them,\\r\\n    perhaps, cases of pemphigus. Quoting Duhring in regard to\\r\\n    pemphigus, I will refer to the following: ‘The mucous membranes\\r\\n    of the mouth, pharynx, epiglottis, trachea, bronchi and\\r\\n    even of the alimentary canal are not infrequently invaded,\\r\\n    especially in the varieties _malignus_ and _vegetanus_, giving\\r\\n    rise to various local lesions, mostly whitish patches and\\r\\n    excoriations. In grave cases there are pain and difficulty in\\r\\n    breathing and swallowing, diarrhea, exhaustion, collapse, and a\\r\\n    fatal ending.’ These cases of mine certainly showed all these\\r\\n    symptoms.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIn answer to this point, Dr. Duhring then said:\\r\\n\\r\\n    “I think Dr. Howe has acted wisely in selecting the title he\\r\\n    has and connecting it with vaccination, because it is to that\\r\\n    point that we wish to call attention, namely, that instances\\r\\n    of bullous dermatitis, often severe and even running a fatal\\r\\n    course, do at times follow vaccination. ... That it is closely\\r\\n    allied to what is known as semi-malignant or malignant\\r\\n    pemphigus; I think probable, but whether we call it bullous\\r\\n    dermatitis from vaccination, or pemphigus from vaccination,\\r\\n    or malignant pemphigus, matters very little at the present\\r\\n    period.”[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nI think we can all readily agree with this conclusion of the doctors,\\r\\nthat it does not matter much what we call this horrible disease caused\\r\\nby vaccination, whether it is “Pemphigus,” “Foot and Mouth Disease” or\\r\\n“Virulent Cowpox,” all of which seem to be fit and proper names, the\\r\\nmain point being that this deadly infection is frequently contained in\\r\\nand conveyed by vaccine virus in the operation of vaccination.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe further interesting and surprising fact to be especially noted\\r\\nhere, is that while some doctors seem to be fully aware that\\r\\n“Pemphigus” is often caused by vaccination, yet they all seem to be\\r\\nquite ignorant of the fact that the cattle plague known as “Foot and\\r\\nMouth Disease” is identical with the disease called “Pemphigus” in man,\\r\\nand which is known to be frequently conveyed to butchers and others who\\r\\nhandle carcasses of cattle.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe doctors in this discussion were also completely ignorant of the\\r\\nfact that a most extensive and virulent epidemic of Foot and Mouth\\r\\nDisease prevailed in New England in that very year, 1902, when these\\r\\ndeadly vaccinations occurred, and that, furthermore, some of the\\r\\nstrains of virus used in that year actually contained the foot and\\r\\nmouth infection and that this dangerous infection came from Japan and\\r\\nactually continued for several years, from 1902 to 1908, as before\\r\\nshown in government reports, thus making a chain of unbreakable facts,\\r\\nwhich, I think, proves the guilt of vaccination for these horrible\\r\\ndeadly results beyond any question.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven if the doctors were inclined to doubt or deny the responsibility\\r\\nof vaccination for these horrible results, they could not, logically\\r\\nor truthfully, do so, for the proof of this causation and relation\\r\\nis written as plainly on the bodies of the pitiable victims as was\\r\\nthe “handwriting on the wall” described in the Bible. And it is now\\r\\nnecessary only to call careful attention to the eruptions shown in Fig.\\r\\n12 to get a full proof of this point, for it will be noted that the\\r\\nvesicles or pustules which appear all over the body in Fig. 12 have a\\r\\nvery distinct “umbilicated” form with a depressed center and raised\\r\\nmargin which is characteristic of only two diseases, vaccination and\\r\\nsmallpox, and a clear proof that either of these two closely related\\r\\ndiseases was surely concerned in this eruption, and that this eruption\\r\\nis therefore essentially a virulent “cowpox” or a mongrel smallpox. On\\r\\nthis point of identity compare Fig. 12 with Figs. 2, 3, 4 and 6, pages\\r\\n83 to 88.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE AWFUL CASE OF A VACCINATED SCHOOL BOY INFECTED WITH FOOT AND MOUTH\\r\\nDISEASE, OR VIRULENT COWPOX, AND IN ERUPTION FOR THREE YEARS!\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the next illustration, Fig. 13, I give another instance of a\\r\\nvaccination horror very similar to or identical with the horrible cases\\r\\njust exposed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe photograph, Fig. 13, shows the case of a vaccinated school boy\\r\\neleven years old infected with foot and mouth disease, virulent cowpox\\r\\nor “pemphigus,” which first appeared a few weeks after vaccination and\\r\\ncontinued intermittently, sometimes in very violent form, for three\\r\\nyears! The boy was vaccinated in September, 1914, and this photograph\\r\\nwas made at my request eleven months afterwards, in August, 1915,\\r\\nduring a comparatively mild stage of the eruptions, which were much\\r\\nworse at other times. These eruptions finally ceased in 1918, after\\r\\nover three years of great suffering by this child victim, and great\\r\\nanxiety and expense on the part of his parents, and so far without\\r\\nany compensation whatever from those responsible for this great evil.\\r\\nWhoever the Law of Justice should decide to be responsible for such a\\r\\nhumanly-inflicted calamity should certainly be made to pay for it.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n    FIG. 13. School boy Arthur Smith, Jr., eleven years old.\\r\\n    Vaccinated September, 1914, photographed August, 1915.\\r\\n    Eruptions similar to foot and mouth disease appeared a few\\r\\n    weeks after vaccination and continued intermittently for over\\r\\n    three years! Photograph shows a mild stage of these eruptions,\\r\\n    which were much worse than this at times. Eruptions ceased in\\r\\n    1918.\\r\\n]\\r\\n\\r\\nI will now let the intelligent father of this afflicted child tell the\\r\\nfull story of this case and the suffering of the boy and his parents,\\r\\nin the father’s own words as taken from his letters to me on this\\r\\nmatter. In his letter dated August 2, 1915, the father, Mr. Arthur\\r\\nSmith, of New Windsor, N. Y., states:\\r\\n\\r\\n    “In reply to your letter of July 29, 1915, in reference to\\r\\n    the condition of my son from vaccination, I wish to say that,\\r\\n    although it is eleven months since he was vaccinated, at the\\r\\n    present time he is in the same condition he was in when the\\r\\n    account of his sickness was published in the _Newburgh Daily\\r\\n    News_, March 12, 1915; and although since then we have taken\\r\\n    him to four different doctors, they have so far failed to do\\r\\n    him a particle of good; in fact, they are at a perfect loss\\r\\n    at the present time as to what is the matter with him. The\\r\\n    greater part of his body from his toes up to the crown of his\\r\\n    head is covered with sores or blisters which are in a continual\\r\\n    form of eruption, which form on his body like a small bubble\\r\\n    which is filled with a water-like substance, and have to be\\r\\n    lanced to let this water out. This is identically the same kind\\r\\n    of blister which began to appear in a short time after he was\\r\\n    vaccinated, and after we called in the physician who vaccinated\\r\\n    him, Dr. Kingston of Newburgh, he immediately pronounced it a\\r\\n    case of cowpox. He left a prescription for him but he rapidly\\r\\n    got worse, so we decided to call in Dr. Barth and he also said\\r\\n    the boy was suffering from a severe case of cowpox; in fact,\\r\\n    he said it was the worst case he had ever seen, and he was\\r\\n    surprised the boy was allowed to get so bad. But I wish to give\\r\\n    Dr. Barth due credit: he worked hard and faithfully to get the\\r\\n    best of the disease. It would take him a full hour at times to\\r\\n    lance all the sores. After bathing him in antiseptic lotion,\\r\\n    he would cover his body with salve and bandage him all up, and\\r\\n    it did appear that, after treating him for about three months,\\r\\n    he had got the best of the disease; in fact, had improved so\\r\\n    much that Dr. Barth said, in due consideration of the cost we\\r\\n    were under, that he thought it would be safe to leave him in\\r\\n    the care of his mother and let him know if he had a relapse.\\r\\n    But I am sorry to say he did not continue to improve; he began\\r\\n    to break out bad again and at the present time he is in the\\r\\n    same condition I have previously stated. It seems to me that,\\r\\n    inasmuch as the State is so insistent upon the subject of\\r\\n    vaccination, there should be something done to put upon some\\r\\n    one the responsibility of the condition in which vaccination\\r\\n    has placed my boy, as it is a continual drain upon my earnings\\r\\n    between the doctors and the drug stores.”\\r\\n\\r\\nOn September 19, 1915, the boy’s father wrote me describing his\\r\\ncondition as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n    “In the first three or four months after vaccination, in\\r\\n    which time he was very bad, the blisters would first form\\r\\n    like vesicles filled with watery fluid, some would get better\\r\\n    without turning into pustules and other blisters would start\\r\\n    the same way, fill up with yellow pus and then get better only\\r\\n    to crop out again in another place. It would be impossible for\\r\\n    me to say how many successive eruptions he had since being\\r\\n    vaccinated as he has practically been in a state of eruption on\\r\\n    one or other part of his body since vaccination (in September,\\r\\n    1914). For a long time his feet and legs were very bad, also\\r\\n    his arms. Then his feet and legs would improve and he would\\r\\n    break out on the head and neck. At the present time (September\\r\\n    19, 1915), with the exception of a few sores on the ankles,\\r\\n    his feet and legs are in pretty good condition, but his head\\r\\n    and neck are very bad; in fact, far worse than when I had\\r\\n    the photograph taken (August, 1915). This is the third time\\r\\n    they have appeared on the head in violent form. The arms have\\r\\n    probably been more affected continually than any other part of\\r\\n    his body and have been very bad all the time, also the back of\\r\\n    the hands, but not on the inside of the hands. He has not as\\r\\n    yet had any sores on the inside of his mouth, but has had them\\r\\n    on the nostrils and on the chin, and the outside of the mouth,\\r\\n    and odd ones on other parts of his face. At the present time\\r\\n    the blisters are about all of the vesicle variety.\\r\\n\\r\\n    “On the 30th of May, 1915, at the suggestion of Dr. Barth, I\\r\\n    took the boy up to Albany to see Dr. Curtis, who is a blood\\r\\n    specialist (Skin Expert in the New York State Department of\\r\\n    Health), and he asked me a good many questions and looked at\\r\\n    the boy’s arms, and after due deliberation he said the boy was\\r\\n    suffering from ‘Pemphigus,’ and he said he had never seen a\\r\\n    case like it, with the exception of one man of 50 years of age,\\r\\n    and he said that he died.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man here referred to as having died from “Pemphigus” after\\r\\nvaccination and as being in a condition similar to that which afflicted\\r\\nthis school boy was doubtless Ernest Hoffman, aged fifty-four,\\r\\narchitect of Albany, N. Y., who died in Albany, March 26, 1908, and\\r\\nwhose case I have carefully studied. The copy of the death certificate\\r\\nin this case, now in my possession, gives the sole and only cause of\\r\\ndeath as “_Pemphigus Vulgaris_,” without any mention, as required by\\r\\nlaw, of the contributory, coincident, primary or secondary disease of\\r\\nvaccination, although it is notorious that this man was vaccinated and\\r\\nwas suffering with a strange and serious skin disease, as a vaccinal\\r\\ncomplication, before his death, and the case was the subject of\\r\\nseveral articles in the local newspapers at the time, as a vaccination\\r\\ncomplication, or disaster. And this is a good instance, right here, to\\r\\nprove my serious charge against vaccinating doctors, that vaccination\\r\\ndisasters are frequently denied and concealed in death certificates,\\r\\neither through ignorance or intention. And this denial or concealment\\r\\nin this case is easily proved because a personal investigation, made by\\r\\none of my colleagues at the time, secured the information and admission\\r\\nthat the patient, Mr. Hoffman, was actually vaccinated with the Mulford\\r\\nvirus, which was officially reported to have contained the infection of\\r\\nfoot and mouth disease at that time, unknown to our doctors and even\\r\\nunknown to the makers of the virus itself! And this infected virus was\\r\\nthe alleged cause of the fearful epidemics of foot and mouth disease in\\r\\ncattle in 1902 and 1908, and the probable cause of the same infection\\r\\nin human victims, as already clearly shown by the government reports\\r\\nand other data previously cited. And, furthermore, as the disease\\r\\ncalled “Pemphigus” has now been proved to be identical or confusible\\r\\nwith foot and mouth disease, I therefore think that a strong chain of\\r\\nfacts has now been drawn around vaccination as being the real cause and\\r\\nsource of the “Pemphigus” in both the dead architect and the surviving\\r\\nschool boy, and in the other cases cited, and that this chain of proof\\r\\nis now complete and unbreakable, and most convincing to any reasonable\\r\\nmind.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor further proof on this point see the Report of the New York State\\r\\nDepartment of Health for 1908, pages 280 to 296, where this case of\\r\\nthe Albany architect, and others, are described, and their relation to\\r\\nvaccination and foot and mouth disease indicated.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe last letter received from the father of the afflicted school boy\\r\\nis dated December 12, 1918, and closes the description of this case,\\r\\nwhich shows a final recovery of the boy, after years of suffering and\\r\\nwith a mutilated or much discolored body, as the result of the many\\r\\neruptions:\\r\\n\\r\\n    “In reply to your letter of December 3, 1918, I wish to say\\r\\n    that my boy at the present time is in fairly good health, and\\r\\n    there are no eruptions on his body and with each succeeding\\r\\n    year the effect seems to be gradually dying away. The summer\\r\\n    of 1917 he broke out in eruption quite bad, especially on the\\r\\n    legs, being most severe on the thighs, and also in the summer\\r\\n    of 1918, but not near so bad as in the preceding summer. He is\\r\\n    free of any eruption at the present time, but the upper part\\r\\n    of his body and especially his arms are covered with a large\\r\\n    amount of brown spots on the skin where the eruptions have\\r\\n    completely died away, but I think that with each succeeding\\r\\n    year, as he grows stronger, the effect will entirely disappear,\\r\\n    with the exception of the brown spots on the skin, which I\\r\\n    suppose will always remain and for which there can be no\\r\\n    remedy.”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nANOTHER BAD CASE OF VIRULENT COWPOX FROM U. S. NAVAL RECORDS\\r\\n\\r\\nTo show how really frequent, common and wide-spread these fearful cases\\r\\nof “pemphigus,” “foot and mouth disease” or virulent cowpox, are, as\\r\\na result of vaccination, I can cite another well authenticated case\\r\\nof this kind, reported in U. S. Naval Records. This case is reported\\r\\nin the _U. S. Naval Medical Bulletin_ for October, 1911, Vol. 5,\\r\\nNo. 4, on page 482--under the heading of “Acute Pemphigus Following\\r\\nVaccination.” This article minutely describes the case of a negro\\r\\ncarpenter, age sixty, employed at one of the U. S. Naval Stations, and\\r\\nvaccinated there, June 9, 1910. About July 9, 1910, an eruption of\\r\\nvesicles appeared first on the vaccinated arm and in a few days spread\\r\\nall over the body. This eruption was exactly similar to that in the\\r\\ncases already described, viz.: vesicles of various sizes which came out\\r\\nin successive crops and on the same parts of the body as in the other\\r\\ncases. And as these vesicles increased they ran together into large\\r\\nconfluent blisters which finally broke and formed denuded scars or raw\\r\\nsores on the skin like scalds or burns. To show that the action on the\\r\\nskin and in the mouth and throat was identical with the other cases\\r\\nhere described, I need only quote a few lines from the official article\\r\\nitself, as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n    “The body and extremities in many places resembled a severe\\r\\n    burn or scald, being covered with large denuded red areas,\\r\\n    surrounded by blebs of various sizes.... Toward the end of the\\r\\n    first week several blebs developed in the mouth, one small one\\r\\n    on the tongue, and one large one on the side of the pharynx.\\r\\n    The latter when it burst ‘_nearly drowned him_,’ according to\\r\\n    his wife.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe patient finally recovered, like the case in Fig. 12, after several\\r\\nsuccessive eruptions and in about four months after vaccination, or in\\r\\nOctober, 1910, and much to the surprise of the doctors, owing to the\\r\\nseverity of the case and the age of the patient.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt may therefore be now noted that this Naval case, together with the\\r\\nothers previously described, show how uniformly distinct and typical\\r\\nthese several cases are, as being undoubtedly examples of the same\\r\\nspecific disease conveyed by vaccination, and are probably nothing more\\r\\nthan a direct degenerated or acute form of the vaccine disease itself\\r\\nor possibly a mongrel form of smallpox which may develop from ordinary\\r\\nvaccination at any time. Concerning this most important point I will\\r\\nhave something further to say after describing the last case of this\\r\\nkind in the next paragraph, which is most suggestive and convincing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA RECENT ENGLISH CASE OF CATTLE POX IN A BABY AND ITS MOTHER, CAUSED BY\\r\\nVACCINATION. IDENTITY OF VACCINAL DISEASES PROVED. A MOST SIGNIFICANT\\r\\nMEDICAL FACT DISCLOSED\\r\\n\\r\\nA recent vaccination horror in a vaccinated baby and its mother,\\r\\nexactly similar to the cases already exposed, is reported in a\\r\\ncircular recently issued by the National Anti-Vaccination League of\\r\\nLondon. This seems to show a clear and horrible case of cattle plague,\\r\\n“foot and mouth disease,” “Pemphigus” or virulent “cowpox” caused by\\r\\nvaccination. And whatever name we may use does not matter much, as\\r\\nbefore stated, for it is evident that any one or all of these names are\\r\\ninterchangeable and appropriate for cases of this kind. In fact, from\\r\\nthe many fatal vaccinations of this type occurring in England from time\\r\\nto time, and usually called “Pemphigus” by the doctors and coroners,\\r\\nit would seem that the strain of virus used in England has become\\r\\npermanently tainted with the “foot and mouth disease” or virulent\\r\\ncowpox, as clearly indicated in this recent English case described below\\r\\n\\r\\n    “On March 26, 1918, Mrs. Woofinden of Birmingham took the\\r\\n    vaccinated child to see the doctor, who said he had a very\\r\\n    good arm. A fortnight after vaccination little white spots\\r\\n    had developed round the principal vaccination place, and\\r\\n    she pointed these out to the doctor, who said, ‘That’s\\r\\n    all right.’... On the following day--sixteen days after\\r\\n    vaccination--a white spot appeared on the baby’s lip, and\\r\\n    the same afternoon one showed itself on the ear. The spot on\\r\\n    the lip got larger. The baby was taken to Dr. Kirby on the\\r\\n    following Monday, but he was out. Next day he was seen, and\\r\\n    declared that the trouble was ‘overflow of vaccination.’ The\\r\\n    child was very cross; its sleep was broken. The vaccination\\r\\n    marks on the arm had run together and formed a big white\\r\\n    blister. The doctor said it would be all right in a week. In\\r\\n    the meantime the mother began to feel very ill; lumps appeared\\r\\n    under each arm, and she found eventually that she had been\\r\\n    vaccinated on both breasts from a sore inside the baby’s\\r\\n    mouth. She suffered intense pain and could no longer nurse the\\r\\n    baby.... Each day, from the 16th day after vaccination, fresh\\r\\n    white blisters had developed in various parts of the body,\\r\\n    turning to a deeper color as they matured, and looking like\\r\\n    miniature vaccination marks.[6]... Finding Dr. Rowlands away\\r\\n    from home, Dr. Kirby arranged for the child’s admission to the\\r\\n    Birmingham Children’s Hospital, where, in just one week, after\\r\\n    intense suffering, the poor little victim expired. The blisters\\r\\n    had spread all over the body, covered the inside of the mouth\\r\\n    and choked up the throat so that the child could not swallow.\\r\\n    The arm swelled so enormously that it seemed to be joined to\\r\\n    the body, and the inflammation spread all over the upper part\\r\\n    till it eventually reached the middle of the chest. The upper\\r\\n    part of the arm became black and raw-looking. Every care was\\r\\n    taken at the hospital, and at one time the doctors thought\\r\\n    they would save the baby’s life, but he got weaker and died\\r\\n    on April 26th--being four months and a day old. Dr. Jordan,\\r\\n    at the hospital, certified that death was due to ‘generalized\\r\\n    vaccinia, followed by pneumonia.’ The case created a great stir\\r\\n    in the hospital, and one doctor who saw it remarked, ‘So that\\r\\n    is true cowpox!’”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMOST IMPORTANT MEDICAL FACT EXPOSED HERE. IDENTITY OF FOOT AND MOUTH\\r\\nDISEASE WITH VACCINATION PROVED\\r\\n\\r\\nYes, Mr. President, please take careful note just here that this\\r\\nis “true cowpox,” as the doctors declared in this last case--the\\r\\nkind of “true cowpox” that is likely to arise at any time from the\\r\\ndangerous infecting operation known as vaccination and the complex\\r\\ninfectious material known as vaccine virus, which thus maims or kills\\r\\nits victims by general blood poisoning and by horrible vesicular and\\r\\npustular eruptions inside and outside the body. And at this stage,\\r\\nMr. President, I would like to call your special attention to a most\\r\\nsignificant medical fact which now stands out clearly in the chain\\r\\nof vaccination horrors here disclosed, and this fact is that all the\\r\\ncases occurring in cattle and mankind, herein shown, from the first\\r\\nepidemic of foot and mouth disease in 1902 to the last isolated case\\r\\nof the English baby in 1918, are of _identical type_, which cannot be\\r\\nmistaken, so that the description of one case will describe all--both\\r\\nin cattle and mankind. Now, surely this identity of type indicates\\r\\nidentity in cause and origin, as we see, for example, that the cattle\\r\\nand human cases in 1902 are identical with the case of the English\\r\\nbaby in 1918, although separated by a time interval of sixteen years,\\r\\nand a geographical distance over continent and ocean--from Boston to\\r\\nBirmingham--of three thousand miles!\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, the experts of the U. S. Bureau of Animal Industry, who have\\r\\nstudied the epidemics of foot and mouth disease in 1902 and 1908 and\\r\\nproved that they were caused by the manufacture of vaccine virus, seem\\r\\nto be of the positive opinion that foot and mouth disease of cattle\\r\\nis a specific disease distinct from “vaccinia” or “cowpox,” and that\\r\\nit was due to some mere chance or accidental infection getting into\\r\\nsome strains of vaccine virus that this cattle disease was conveyed to\\r\\nanimals and mankind in said epidemics. This theory may be true, but\\r\\nI do not think it has yet been proved, and I believe that it is more\\r\\nprobable that the very complex disease known as cowpox or vaccinia\\r\\nis capable at any time of conveying to animals or man the dangerous\\r\\ninfection known as “foot and mouth disease,” “Pemphigus,” “virulent\\r\\ncowpox” or “generalized vaccinia,” and that these diseases are not\\r\\ndistinct but are identical and confusible with each other, and that the\\r\\nseveral cases herein shown prove this latter theory, as they are all\\r\\nidentical in type although separated by long intervals of time and long\\r\\ndistances of space and all occurring as a direct result of vaccination!\\r\\nFurthermore, a great many cases like that of the Albany architect in\\r\\n1908 and the English baby in 1918 have occurred in England in the\\r\\npast few years and are generally treated as a great mystery by the\\r\\nvaccinating doctors, although they are, in fact, quite common and their\\r\\nrelation to vaccination obvious, and these cases are usually called\\r\\n“generalized vaccinia,” “overflow of vaccination” or “Pemphigus” by the\\r\\nEnglish coroners who have passed on many fatal vaccinations of this\\r\\ntype in the last ten years.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf, therefore, it is still maintained that foot and mouth disease is\\r\\ndistinct from vaccinia, then it seems that this deadly cattle plague\\r\\nhas now become a permanent taint in the different strains of vaccine\\r\\nvirus used in this country and in England! On the other hand, if foot\\r\\nand mouth disease is not distinct from vaccinia, then it is proved\\r\\nthat the horrible and deadly cases of vaccinal disease herein exposed\\r\\nare a normal or regular effect of ordinary vaccination, likely to\\r\\nresult at any time therefrom, and to produce epidemics in cattle or\\r\\nmankind; and this proof, therefore, makes general vaccination obviously\\r\\na much more dangerous and deadly disease than natural smallpox! Surely,\\r\\nMr. President, this shocking fact calls for immediate attention and the\\r\\nabolishment of all compulsory vaccination, as being now more dangerous\\r\\nto human health and life than the natural disease it is designed to\\r\\nprevent, and this shocking fact can be easily proved by such examples\\r\\nas already given and by many others now concealed and withheld in\\r\\nour vital records, as already solemnly charged in my general public\\r\\nchallenge on page vi.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nVACCINATION IS DOCTORED SMALLPOX. IT ASSUMES VARIOUS FORMS AND IS OFTEN\\r\\nWORSE THAN NATURAL SMALLPOX\\r\\n\\r\\nThe doctors apply the terms “generalized vaccinia” to any form of\\r\\nvaccinal disease where the eruption becomes _general_ over the body, as\\r\\nin smallpox, instead of being localized and confined to the vaccination\\r\\nwound. Now, there are two types of this generalized vaccinia--the first\\r\\nbeing shown in Fig. 5 and the second in Figs. 11, 12 and 13. In the\\r\\nfirst type, the eruption advances to the full pustular stage and the\\r\\npustules remain either separate or run together in large confluent\\r\\nmasses, and these scab over with a dry crust or scab, the same as in\\r\\nconfluent smallpox, which it greatly resembles and to which it is\\r\\nequivalent in nature and deadly result, as is fully shown in Fig.\\r\\n5. In the other type, the eruption does not advance to the pustular\\r\\nstage, but continues in the vesicular and half-pustular stage and runs\\r\\ntogether into large confluent blisters which do not scab over, but\\r\\nbreak and excoriate, leaving large denuded or raw sores on the skin\\r\\nlike scalds or burns, as shown in Figs. 11, 12 and 13. Now, it is\\r\\nthis latter form which is identical with “foot and mouth disease” and\\r\\n“Pemphigus,” and, if anything, it is more agonizing and deadly than\\r\\nthe other form and is much more severe and fatal than ordinary, natural\\r\\nsmallpox, although, perhaps, not so contagious, as clearly proved by\\r\\nthe many horrible cases in child, adult and domestic animals herein\\r\\nillustrated.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt should, therefore, be clearly understood at this point that\\r\\nvaccination as now practiced is really only a form of human smallpox\\r\\nor “variola” combined with “cowpox” and that the vaccine virus now in\\r\\nuse is produced directly from and originates in the virus of human\\r\\nsmallpox, which is transplanted on the body of the cow and thence\\r\\nused on the human body, so that it necessarily conveys both human and\\r\\ncow infections to the human body; whereas the original vaccination of\\r\\nJenner was taken from some much disputed or unknown disease in the\\r\\nhorse or cow and thence transferred directly to the human arm, and\\r\\nthence from arm to arm. This was found to be such a dangerous practice\\r\\nthat it was long ago condemned and abandoned, and the present practice\\r\\nof combined human and bovine smallpox adopted, which I believe to be\\r\\nas dangerous as the old arm-to-arm vaccination--if not more so. As\\r\\npresent vaccination is, therefore, a combination of human smallpox\\r\\nand cow disease, should there be any wonder if it should convey to\\r\\nthe human body, at any time, some mild or deadly form of smallpox, or\\r\\nsome mild or deadly form of cow disease as shown in the several cases\\r\\nherein illustrated? And it is a serious question here whether these\\r\\ncases of cow disease and vaccinal disease herein illustrated are not\\r\\nall really only various forms of that very various disease known as\\r\\n“variola” or smallpox and all caused by vaccination, which is itself,\\r\\nessentially, smallpox at base and origin! Indeed, many students of\\r\\nthis subject believe that modern vaccination, which originates from\\r\\nsmallpox virus, is partly responsible for causing modern epidemics of\\r\\nsmallpox, just as the old prohibited inoculation with smallpox virus\\r\\nwas proved to spread the disease and cause epidemics which declined\\r\\nas soon as this inoculation was abandoned and prohibited by penal\\r\\nlaw. In the same way smallpox has declined in every modern sanitary\\r\\ncommunity where vaccination has been reduced or abandoned, as already\\r\\nshown on page 22, and this being the fact, the abolishment of all\\r\\ncompulsory vaccination, and the allowance of voluntary vaccination\\r\\nonly, must, surely, to say the least, commend itself to all thoughtful\\r\\nand reasonable minds as a most wise, safe and conservative sanitary and\\r\\nhygienic reform!\\r\\n\\r\\nIt should also be understood at this point that investigators have,\\r\\nso far, failed to discover or isolate the specific germs of smallpox\\r\\n“vaccinia” and foot and mouth disease, but these germs are all\\r\\nknown to belong to the class of microbes termed “ultra-microscopic”\\r\\nand “filterable,” that is, so fine and minute that they cannot be\\r\\ndistinguished by the microscope and will pass through the finest\\r\\nfilters without change. This shows that the germ of foot and mouth\\r\\ndisease, whatever it may be, is in the same class with that of smallpox\\r\\nand vaccinia, and may ultimately prove to be identical or closely\\r\\nrelated, as I contend and believe to be the fact.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPROOF THAT VACCINATION CAUSES MONGREL SMALLPOX AND FOOT AND MOUTH\\r\\nDISEASE AND THAT THE NATURE OF THE VACCINAL ERUPTIONS PROVES THE\\r\\nIDENTITY OF THESE DISEASES\\r\\n\\r\\nThe nature and location of the eruptions found in natural smallpox and\\r\\nin “Generalized Vaccination,” “Acute Pemphigus,” “Virulent Cowpox” and\\r\\n“Foot and Mouth Disease” conclusively prove that these several diseases\\r\\nare closely related, or identical in their essential nature, and are\\r\\nprobably varieties of the same generic disease.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor example, no disease but smallpox and its relatives has the profuse\\r\\nvesicular or partly pustular eruptions _on the inside of the mouth\\r\\nand throat_ combined with vesicular or pustular eruptions, usually\\r\\nof “umbilicated” form, on the skin of the body and limbs. Now, these\\r\\ncharacteristic and combined eruptions are distinctly found in both the\\r\\nanimal and human cases of virulent cowpox or foot and mouth disease\\r\\nshown herein and all caused by, and originating from, vaccination,\\r\\nwhich is, of course, in itself, nothing but a form of smallpox in\\r\\nsubstance and origin. These characteristic eruptions are particularly\\r\\nwell shown in the human cases illustrated in Figs. 11, 12 and 13,\\r\\nalso in the case of the negro naval carpenter on page 122, and in the\\r\\ncase of the English baby on page 123, which latter is a particularly\\r\\ncomplete, frightful and convincing case of this positive proof against\\r\\nvaccination. Substantially the same conditions exist also in the many\\r\\ncases of Foot and Mouth Disease in cattle, illustrated in Figs. 7, 8,\\r\\n8½ and 9, in all of which cases the same eruptions occur inside the\\r\\nmouth and throat and on the feet, teats and udder, and sometimes on\\r\\nother parts of the external skin similar to what occur in the human\\r\\nsubject. For typical eruptions on teats and udder, see Fig. 8½, page\\r\\n95, taken from _Farmers’ Bulletin_, No. 666, before cited, issued by U.\\r\\nS. Department of Agriculture.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAN INDICTMENT AGAINST BOVINE VACCINATION\\r\\n\\r\\nIf, therefore, the apologists for vaccination now wish to deny or\\r\\nexcuse its responsibility for causing Mongrel Smallpox or Foot and\\r\\nMouth Disease in animals and man, as herein clearly shown, they cannot\\r\\ndo so, as the cases here illustrated surely carry their own proof on\\r\\ntheir very faces, as just pointed out, and each case carries the “sign\\r\\nmanual” of this deadly vaccination-pox branded on the body of each\\r\\nvictim, so plain, indelible and convicting that no vaccination apology\\r\\ncan erase it.\\r\\n\\r\\nI, therefore, believe that the facts now herein disclosed constitute\\r\\nnothing less than a moral and medical indictment against all Bovine\\r\\nVaccination, particularly that evil practice of compulsory vaccination\\r\\nwhich would force this dangerous disease of “vaccination-pox” upon\\r\\nchild or adult, soldier or sailor, against free will and consent, and\\r\\nunder the false representation that it is necessary for health and is\\r\\nperfectly safe and harmless, whereas it is, in fact, highly dangerous\\r\\nto human and animal life and frequently more dangerous and fatal than\\r\\nnatural smallpox, as fully demonstrated in these pages.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHOW ONE STRAIN OF VACCINE VIRUS ORIGINATED FROM ONE SMALLPOX TRAMP--AND\\r\\nAN INFECTED COW.

No one seems to know\\r\\n    positively the exact nature of this product. It would seem\\r\\n    to us, however, that the theory that cowpox is but modified\\r\\n    smallpox, is the most tenable one. Particularly does this seem\\r\\n    true in view of the facts reported by Dr. Monckton Copeman,\\r\\n    Director of the Government Vaccine work in London, that he had\\r\\n    been able to take smallpox virus, transmit it to monkeys, from\\r\\n    monkeys to heifers, and from heifers to man, the resulting\\r\\n    vaccination on the human subject being identically the same as\\r\\n    that produced by vaccine as ordinarily prepared. Furthermore it\\r\\n    was shown that the persons vaccinated with this vaccine, when\\r\\n    exposed to smallpox, were immune. In other words, the chain of\\r\\n    evidence seems very complete, that by properly transferring\\r\\n    the smallpox virus from man to animals of different species it\\r\\n    became so modified in the transmission that, when applied to\\r\\n    heifers, it produced typical vaccinia, and was found to fill\\r\\n    every requirement as a means of protecting against smallpox\\r\\n    when applied to unimmunized children.\\r\\n\\r\\n    On theoretical grounds it seems to us that this is a very\\r\\n    plausible explanation of the origin of vaccinia. During\\r\\n    Jenner’s time smallpox was very prevalent and nothing could\\r\\n    be more natural than for persons recovering from smallpox\\r\\n    to transmit the disease to the udders of cows, producing an\\r\\n    infection which, on account of the difference in the species of\\r\\n    the animal, modified the smallpox virus.\\r\\n\\r\\n    Regretting that we are unable to state more positively the\\r\\n    exact relation between the two diseases and the origin of the\\r\\n    seed as used by manufacturers, we remain,\\r\\n\\r\\n      Very sincerely yours,\\r\\n      (Signed) PARKE, DAVIS & CO.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE DISPUTED OR UNKNOWN ORIGIN AND NATURE OF MODERN VACCINE VIRUS\\r\\nEMPHASIZED.

After Vaccination]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCASE OF HENRY PLANT\\r\\n\\r\\nOn September 1, 1911, at the age of eighteen years and eight months,\\r\\nHenry Plant was admitted into the Royal Navy, at Wolverhampton, as a\\r\\nsecond-class stoker, and passed a searching medical examination by a\\r\\nnaval doctor at Birmingham. He was sent to Portsmouth, served on the\\r\\n“Victory” till September 24, and was then drafted to the “Renown.”\\r\\nShortly afterwards he was vaccinated in three places, high up on the\\r\\nleft shoulder. On October 19, 1911, he was admitted to the Royal Naval\\r\\nHospital, Haslar, suffering from influenza. Severe shooting pains from\\r\\nthe left shoulder to the finger-tips developed, and for sixteen days he\\r\\nwas treated for rheumatism. After sixteen days’ intense suffering an\\r\\noperation was performed, an abscess was discovered, and from this time\\r\\ntill the arm was amputated on July 9, 1912, the poor fellow suffered\\r\\nunceasingly. Four Members of Parliament took up the case, and the final\\r\\nresult was a compassionate grant of £50 compensation and the offer of\\r\\na situation at Devonport under the Admiralty. Representatives worked\\r\\nfor nearly seven months to secure justice for the young man, and though\\r\\nthe Admiralty have never admitted that the loss of the arm was due to\\r\\nvaccination, their action in compensating Plant is an admission of\\r\\nresponsibility. The facts in this and the following case are taken from\\r\\na circular issued by The National Anti-Vaccination League, London.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDEATH OF AN ENGLISH SOLDIER FROM TYPHOID VACCINATION. A TYPICAL CASE\\r\\n\\r\\nThe _Finchley Press_, for November 13, 1914, contained the following\\r\\nparticulars:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n    “MILITARY HONOURS.\\r\\n\\r\\n    “FUNERAL OF A FINCHLEY DRILL-INSTRUCTOR YESTERDAY.\\r\\n\\r\\n    “Drill-Instructor Nichols, of 42, Sedgemere Avenue, who was\\r\\n    well known in Finchley, has passed away at the age of fifty-one\\r\\n    as the result of _the after effects of inoculation_. A big,\\r\\n    strong, healthy-looking man, the news will come as a surprise\\r\\n    to those who knew him.\\r\\n\\r\\n    “There was a large attendance at St. Marylebone Cemetery at the\\r\\n    funeral yesterday (Thursday) afternoon, when Mr. Nichols was\\r\\n    buried with military honours.”\\r\\n\\r\\nA resident at East Finchley sent the following particulars to the\\r\\nAnti-Vaccination League of London:\\r\\n\\r\\n    “Mr. Nichols had been a Territorial for about eight years, and\\r\\n    as a boy was intended for Sandhurst College, but circumstances\\r\\n    prevented this. A keen soldier, and particularly clever\\r\\n    at drilling recruits, he was being kept for Home Service.\\r\\n    Understanding that inoculation was compulsory for the men, he\\r\\n    underwent the operation as an example and encouragement.\\r\\n\\r\\n    [Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n        FIG. 16. Sergeant H. Nichols, of East Finchley, England,\\r\\n        died on November 4, 1914, from the effects of anti-typhoid\\r\\n        inoculation.\\r\\n    ]\\r\\n\\r\\n    “On Saturday, October 24, he was inoculated a second time on\\r\\n    the left side of chest. He was taken ill at once and went home\\r\\n    to bed, complaining of a dreadful beating on the top of his\\r\\n    brain. On the Monday he reported himself ill and was given\\r\\n    the half-day off with the others, but passed for duty for the\\r\\n    Tuesday and Wednesday and sent on an eight-mile march. On the\\r\\n    Thursday he woke up with severe trembling, later on partial\\r\\n    paralysis set in with very severe delirium, kidney trouble,\\r\\n    swollen tongue and many other distressing symptoms. Also\\r\\n    his heart, which had always been passed as perfectly sound,\\r\\n    was very bad. Two nurses and his own doctor (a believer in\\r\\n    inoculation) attended him. On the day of his death, November 4,\\r\\n    his pulse was 144.\\r\\n\\r\\n    “Sergeant Nichols was a very strong man, never ill, and looked\\r\\n    more like forty than fifty years of age. His photograph\\r\\n    indicates his ‘fitness.’ For some time before his death he\\r\\n    did sergeant’s work and was known as full platoon sergeant,\\r\\n    but the papers verifying this only came through, Mrs. Nichols\\r\\n    understood, just about the time of his death, so that he is\\r\\n    described as corporal on death certificate, but she says he had\\r\\n    a sergeant’s funeral and is described as such on the gravestone.\\r\\n\\r\\n    “Mr. Nichols’ death was a great shock to his friends, some of\\r\\n    whom saw him two weeks before death, when he was telling them\\r\\n    how ‘very fit’ he was feeling, and how thoroughly his heart was\\r\\n    in his work.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe death certificate in this case gives the cause of death as:\\r\\n\\r\\n    1. “Anti-Typhoid Vaccination.” 2. “Pneumonia.”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSICKNESS AND DEATH FROM VACCINATIONS IN U. S. ARMY\\r\\n\\r\\nWe cite this fatal English case here out of many others on record\\r\\nin this country and England because it is so typical and such a\\r\\nplain example of many cases of sickness and death caused by typhoid\\r\\nvaccination since its adoption several years ago. How many cases of\\r\\nillness or death have been truly caused by this and other kinds of\\r\\nvaccination in the Army and Navy, in recent years, can probably be\\r\\naccurately determined only by a special committee of investigation\\r\\nappointed by the Commander-in-Chief or by Congress, and so selected as\\r\\nto be entirely free of any medical or professional interest or bias.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe office of the Surgeon General of the U. S. Army in answer to\\r\\nmy request for information on this point admits that many cases of\\r\\nsickness have been caused by smallpox and typhoid vaccination in the\\r\\nArmy in the year 1917, but states that no deaths have been caused by\\r\\nany form of vaccination in said year 1917, and that the data for the\\r\\nyear 1918 are not yet available. The figures admitted for sickness from\\r\\nthe two forms of vaccination stated seem to be serious and significant\\r\\nand are now given below in the words of the letter addressed to me from\\r\\nthe Surgeon General’s office, March 15, 1919, as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n    “The number of men admitted to sick report during 1917 for\\r\\n    typhoid vaccination was 10,549, or a rate of 15.54 for each one\\r\\n    thousand men.\\r\\n\\r\\n    “For smallpox vaccination the number admitted was 9,059, or a\\r\\n    rate of 13.35 for each one thousand men.\\r\\n\\r\\n    “The total number of days lost as the result of typhoid\\r\\n    vaccination was 28,679 and for smallpox 34,814.”\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, I think that this shows a rather serious and significant amount\\r\\nof sickness which can thus incapacitate about fifteen men out of every\\r\\nthousand for several days, or about one and a half per cent. of the\\r\\nwhole Army! And, surely, where such deliberately inflicted vaccinal\\r\\ndiseases forced on the soldiers cause such an amount of sickness as is\\r\\nhere admitted, they are also likely to cause death in some cases and do\\r\\nfrequently cause death in many cases, as I have already demonstrated\\r\\nbeyond question.\\r\\n\\r\\nI, therefore, believe that the statement that no deaths have been\\r\\ncaused in the U. S. Army from vaccination in 1917 is possibly not\\r\\ncorrect, and that a careful investigation by unbiased investigators\\r\\nwould probably show that many deaths have been so caused directly or\\r\\nindirectly by the present barbarous system of compulsory vaccination,\\r\\nor inflicted disease, which admittedly causes so much sickness.\\r\\nVaccinating doctors who believe in this barbarism of compulsory disease\\r\\nand force it upon their helpless patients under the false pleas that\\r\\nit is actually necessary, perfectly harmless and surely effective,\\r\\nhave obviously an evil professional bias and interest to deny and\\r\\nconceal the real facts whenever some “complication” or “infection”\\r\\ncaused by the vaccination arises and extends and finally kills the\\r\\npatient; and in such case the coercive doctor can very easily satisfy\\r\\nhis conscience and compromise “statistics” by recording the death as\\r\\ndue solely to one or more of the “complications” and not at all to the\\r\\nvaccination, which, as a matter of fact, I know to be a common thing\\r\\nwith vaccinators in civic practice. Indeed, it is admitted in official\\r\\nreports that a similar careless practice as to false diagnosis and\\r\\nincorrect report of cause of death exists in some cases in the U. S.\\r\\nArmy where, for example, actual typhoid fever in vaccinated men had\\r\\nbeen reported as “Influenza” and where death of vaccinated men from\\r\\ntyphoid was entered as due solely to one of the complications such as\\r\\n“Peritonitis,” “Broncho-Pneumonia,” etc. See page 207, showing failure\\r\\nof vaccination in U. S. Army, from Report of the Chief Surgeon of the\\r\\nA. E. F. in France.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe English example of Sergeant Nichols, above given, well illustrates\\r\\nthe very grave and sudden illness frequently caused by typhoid\\r\\nvaccination, sometimes resulting in death and usually involving some\\r\\nform of paralysis, heart failure, meningitis and pneumonia, as in this\\r\\nNichols case, where evidently paralysis and pneumonia were the two\\r\\nchief complicating and terminal diseases which resulted in death. This\\r\\nfact is very significant here because meningitis and pneumonia are now\\r\\ntwo of the chief causes of death in the Army, and there is a strong\\r\\nchain of evidence showing that these two diseases have a positive\\r\\nrelation to vaccination and are probably caused or aggravated thereby,\\r\\nand this point is most important in showing the dangerous infecting\\r\\nnature of vaccination both in itself and in its relation to and\\r\\ncombination with other disease infections, as I will prove in the next\\r\\nparagraph.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMOST IMPORTANT MEDICAL POINT ESTABLISHED. RELATION OF VACCINATION\\r\\nTO THE TWO CHIEF CAUSES OF DEATH IN THE ARMY--PNEUMONIA AND\\r\\nMENINGITIS--PROVED\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is a most interesting and suggestive fact that two of the chief\\r\\ncauses of death in the Army are meningitis and pneumonia, and it is\\r\\nalso most significant that the Army death-rate from these two diseases,\\r\\nboth relatively and absolutely, is much higher than in the civil\\r\\npopulation, although the Army is composed of picked men of the highest\\r\\nphysical type and best health, while the civil population contains all\\r\\nthe weaklings and diseased and the average types. On this important\\r\\npoint see the latest Report of the Surgeon General of the United States\\r\\nArmy for 1918, covering the statistics of the year 1917. On pages 44,\\r\\n236, 285 and 286 in this report it is shown that the chief causes of\\r\\ndeath in the Army in 1917 were pneumonia, measles and meningitis in\\r\\nthe order stated, and that pneumonia causes about thirty-two per cent.\\r\\nof all deaths, measles thirty per cent., meningitis ten per cent. and\\r\\nscarlet fever about two per cent. As regards the greater frequency of\\r\\nthese diseases in the Army than in the civil population, it is shown at\\r\\npage 236 that measles is two hundred times more frequent, meningitis\\r\\nfifteen times more frequent, pneumonia twelve times more frequent,\\r\\nand scarlet fever ten times more frequent in the Army than in the\\r\\ncivil population! It is, therefore, believed that this extraordinarily\\r\\nhigh death-rate in the Army from meningitis and pneumonia, where it\\r\\nshould be the lowest, is due to the extensive repeated and multiple\\r\\nvaccinations of various kinds now used in the Army, which greatly\\r\\nexceed the ratio of vaccination in the civil population. This fact,\\r\\ncombined with the closely related fact that meningitis and pneumonia\\r\\nare regularly and constantly two of the most common complications\\r\\nin fatal cases of vaccination, furnishes convincing proof of the\\r\\npossible responsibility of vaccination for being the cause of the\\r\\nepidemics of meningitis and pneumonia in our excessively vaccinated\\r\\nArmy within the last two years. For example, in many of the cases of\\r\\nfatal vaccination, which I have investigated, or have on record, for\\r\\nseveral years past, I find that pneumonia and meningitis figure as\\r\\nthe chief complicating diseases which have caused death in acting as\\r\\na secondary, double, or mixed infection with the primary infection\\r\\nof the vaccination, and that these two diseases are the most common\\r\\ncomplications together with septicemia and lockjaw in all fatal\\r\\nvaccinations. Indeed, the several fatal vaccinations illustrated\\r\\nin this chapter of vaccination horrors prove this point clearly,\\r\\nas most of them show pneumonia or meningitis or both as the fatal\\r\\ncomplications. For example, in the case of the Waters boy described\\r\\non page 168, it appears from the autopsy and hospital report in my\\r\\npossession that pneumonia and meningitis were the fatal complications\\r\\nwith the vaccination and are set down in these records as the chief\\r\\ncauses of death.\\r\\n\\r\\nLikewise, in the case of the English soldier and the English baby on\\r\\npages 135 and 123, pneumonia appears as the complicating disease and\\r\\nthe final cause of death in both cases. Furthermore, in Dr. Howe’s six\\r\\nfatal cases in 1902, described on page 113, one of which is illustrated\\r\\nin Fig. 11, page 110, it was found that severe lung lesions existed\\r\\nin four of these cases involving lobar and broncho-pneumonia and\\r\\npleurisy. In the eleven cases of fatal vaccination taken from Mr.\\r\\nLoyster’s pamphlet on pages 145 to 159, meningitis figures as the fatal\\r\\ncomplication in three cases, paralysis in three cases and lockjaw in\\r\\nfive cases.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn explanation of these several cases where vaccination has evidently\\r\\nacted as a primary infection, complicated with the secondary or mixed\\r\\ninfection of some other co-acting disease, it may be stated that the\\r\\ngerms of these very deadly diseases, such as lockjaw, meningitis and\\r\\npneumonia, seem to be normally diffused widely in the human body, or\\r\\nin its surroundings, where they are normally perfectly inert, dormant\\r\\nand harmless, but are aroused into deadly activity by the dangerous\\r\\nprimary infecting action of vaccination, which, being a pus or\\r\\nsepticemic infection, seems to provide conditions for the growth or\\r\\nactivation of the dormant disease germs which would otherwise remain\\r\\nperfectly harmless, just as gunpowder remains perfectly inert and\\r\\nharmless until touched by an igniting spark. And it would, therefore,\\r\\nseem that vaccination thus evidently acts as an igniter or “activator”\\r\\nto these dormant indwelling infections and causes the double or\\r\\n“mixed infection” which finally produces the deadly effect. In fact,\\r\\nit seems that most deaths are caused by double or mixed infections,\\r\\nor by several diseases acting in combination or complication, and\\r\\nthat comparatively few deaths are caused by one simple disease acting\\r\\nalone. And it also seems to be a fact that the vitality of the human\\r\\nbody is usually so great and its natural safeguards so many that it\\r\\nordinarily yields only to a complicated attack of several diseases\\r\\ncombined. If this view is correct, and it seems to accord with modern\\r\\nmedical theories and experience, then the folly of the whole scheme\\r\\nof multiple vaccinations seems to be apparent in the evident fallacy\\r\\nof expecting to defend the body against natural infections by filling\\r\\nit with a whole series of inflicted infections which arouse the most\\r\\ndeadly but dormant infections already in the body! Furthermore, many\\r\\nof these inflicted infections are almost purely experimental and\\r\\nunknown as to their really final or ultimate effect. In other cases\\r\\nthe infections are known to be more or less dangerous and deadly in\\r\\ntheir possibilities, and even at their best have the effect only of\\r\\ngiving immunity for a short while, perhaps for a few months, from such\\r\\ncomparatively minor diseases as smallpox and typhoid fever, while they\\r\\nmake the human body more susceptible to diseases of ten or one hundred\\r\\ntimes greater frequency and fatality, such as pneumonia, meningitis,\\r\\nmeasles and scarlet fever.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this point we might again quote from one of the latest medical\\r\\nworks and one of the leading doctors of to-day, viz., from Osler’s\\r\\n“Principles and Practice of Medicine,” eighth edition, 1918, page 330,\\r\\nwhere the point just argued is clearly recognized as to the effect\\r\\nof vaccination in exciting other diseases and is expressed in these\\r\\ndistinct words:\\r\\n\\r\\n    “Influence of Vaccination Upon Other Diseases: A quiescent\\r\\n    malady may be lighted into activity by vaccination. This\\r\\n    has happened with congenital syphilis, occasionally with\\r\\n    tuberculosis.”\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, as regards the extraordinary prevalence of the two other diseases,\\r\\nscarlet fever and measles, in the Army, it is a rather strange and\\r\\nsuggestive coincidence that these two deadly infantile diseases are\\r\\nmore closely related to smallpox and vaccination than any other known\\r\\ndiseases,--so much so, in fact, that in olden times they were actually\\r\\nconsidered as forms of smallpox and were not differentiated therefrom\\r\\nas in modern times; and they are, of course, very often, to-day,\\r\\nconfounded with smallpox by inexpert doctors before the eruption is\\r\\nfully developed, or in mild types of smallpox which are often mistaken\\r\\nfor scarlet fever or measles. These facts would therefore seem to\\r\\nindicate that the excessive smallpox or cowpox vaccinations in the army\\r\\nmay have had some relation to the excessive measles and scarlet fever\\r\\nas well as to the excessive pneumonia and meningitis; and this point\\r\\nis worthy of careful consideration, to say the least, and cannot be\\r\\nconsistently or logically ignored by any unbiased student of epidemic\\r\\ndiseases and present-day medical practices.\\r\\n\\r\\nI therefore submit, Mr. President, that in the many co-related and\\r\\nconvincing facts above stated, there is surely presented a strong chain\\r\\nof circumstantial evidence showing that the excessive vaccination in\\r\\nthe Army and Navy may be the cause of the excessive death-rate from\\r\\nmeningitis and pneumonia, and in this showing there is surely to be\\r\\nfound the strongest and most compelling reason why all compulsory\\r\\nvaccination should now be permanently abolished in the Army and Navy,\\r\\nand only voluntary vaccination permitted hereafter.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE SLAUGHTER OF THE INNOCENTS ILLUSTRATED.

H.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nINTRODUCTION\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE object of this pamphlet is to publish the result of a painstaking\\r\\ninquiry into the effects of vaccination in the State of New York in\\r\\n1914.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy immediate personal interest in the subject is due to the death of my\\r\\nonly son as a result of vaccination.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have been a believer in and advocate of vaccination. I was myself\\r\\nvaccinated in childhood by the arm-to-arm method without ill effects.\\r\\nIt was in accordance with this belief and in an honest effort to\\r\\ncomply with the law that I had my son vaccinated. Even his death did\\r\\nnot entirely shake my faith in the practice, but it led me to make an\\r\\ninvestigation of the results of vaccination in New York State in 1914.\\r\\nOwing to the difficulty of making a canvass in the great cities, no\\r\\neffort was made to collect statistics in New York and Buffalo, and\\r\\nbut little in Rochester, Syracuse or Albany. My investigations were,\\r\\ntherefore, practically confined to the rural or semi-rural portions of\\r\\nthe State.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe result has been the gathering of such an appalling story of death\\r\\nand illness as to completely shatter my belief in the wisdom of\\r\\nenforced vaccination.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt should be understood that I am not a physician. This leaves me free\\r\\nto write with greater frankness in certain instances than would be\\r\\npermitted to a doctor by the ethics of his profession.\\r\\n\\r\\nI desire to be understood as seeking nothing but the common good of\\r\\nhumanity. In the pages that follow I have attempted to write without\\r\\nbias as far as is humanly possible. Only established facts are\\r\\npresented; extravagant statements have been avoided; in no single\\r\\ninstance has a quotation been made from an anti-vaccination source. I\\r\\nhave felt that my case is so strong that I could afford to be generous\\r\\nin my arguments.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe reader is invited to go over the facts as presented and draw his\\r\\nown conclusions as to the accuracy of the deductions made.\\r\\n\\r\\n  JAMES A.

It appears almost certain that this was what\\r\\n    may be called an “abortive” or “arrested” case of infantile\\r\\n    paralysis. The fact that he was vaccinated simultaneously\\r\\n    with his sister, who died of a transparent case of infantile\\r\\n    paralysis, is strong presumptive evidence of a common origin\\r\\n    of the two cases in the vaccine. Cumulative evidence of\\r\\n    this common origin in the virus, and of the possibility of\\r\\n    transmitting infantile paralysis by means of the vaccine\\r\\n    abrasion, is found in a _third case in the same house_, as\\r\\n    follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCASE No. 29\\r\\n\\r\\n    CHARLES S.

These three cases in\\r\\n    the same house, with identical symptoms, following vaccination\\r\\n    in exactly the same period of time, furnish the most damaging\\r\\n    evidence against vaccine that has been brought to light in the\\r\\n    present investigation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. LOYSTER’S ARGUMENT AND PROOF THAT INFANTILE PARALYSIS IS CAUSED BY\\r\\nVACCINATION\\r\\n\\r\\nThe theory of the possibility of conveying infantile paralysis through\\r\\nvaccine abrasions as well as the probability of the vaccine having\\r\\ncontained the germs receives startling confirmation in three cases in\\r\\nthe home of S. V. Minnick of Carthage, reported under numbers 27, 28,\\r\\nand 29. Ruth, 10½, and Hobart, 13, were vaccinated the same day _from\\r\\nthe same tube of virus_. Both became very sick in just ten days from\\r\\nvaccination. The boy, being older, recovered, after a severe illness,\\r\\nwith symptoms much like the girl. Ruth died after a plain case of\\r\\ninfantile paralysis, which was so reported by her attending physician.\\r\\nFour days before the little girl’s death, in compliance with the\\r\\ndemand of the school authorities, the little brother, Charles, age 6,\\r\\nwas vaccinated. In precisely 10 days he, also, became very sick, with\\r\\nsymptoms practically identical with the other two children. He was\\r\\n_unconscious and helpless_ for two weeks, but recovered with a slight\\r\\nresidual paralysis. He was attended by another physician and the only\\r\\ndiagnosis reported is “vaccination.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSimultaneous cases of infantile paralysis in the same family have\\r\\nhitherto been so rare as to excite comment. Many physicians with large\\r\\npractice have never had an instance in their entire practice. Here are\\r\\n_three_ in one house.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe theory of “subsequent infection” needs extensive “bracing” in this\\r\\ninstance; and then there is Case 19 with onset in 12 days; Case 24,\\r\\nonset in 11 days; Case 25, onset in 11 days; unquestionably paralysis\\r\\ncases, with practically identical incubation periods, all contributing\\r\\nevidence of a common and simultaneous infection. What other possible\\r\\ncommon origin except the vaccine virus is it possible to place under\\r\\nsuspicion? It is unthinkable that these children, widely scattered\\r\\nin different portions of the State, with no history of near-by\\r\\nparalysis cases, could have each accidentally acquired the germ in the\\r\\nvaccination wound exactly ten or eleven days from vaccination. Such a\\r\\ntheory presupposes a universal distribution of the poliomyelitis germ\\r\\nentirely at variance with observation and experience.\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\n    _Note._ Vaccination is acknowledged to be one of the causes\\r\\n    of Infantile Paralysis by a recent medical authority on this\\r\\n    subject, Dr. Oskar Vulpius, in a book published by Wm. Wood &\\r\\n    Company of New York, 1912.--C. M. H.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. LOYSTER’S CONCLUSIONS\\r\\n\\r\\nIt has been the intent of the writer to present facts rather than to\\r\\nparticipate in a controversy that is still unsettled after a century\\r\\nof argument; but as a result of the investigation of over fifty\\r\\nvaccination disasters and the almost constant study of vaccination\\r\\nliterature for several months, it seems that the following conclusions\\r\\nare warranted and should be frankly stated:\\r\\n\\r\\n(1) Vaccination has been the cause, directly or indirectly, of the\\r\\ndeath of at least fifty children in New York State in 1914. The record\\r\\nherewith printed gives only the cases occurring in rural or suburban\\r\\ndistricts. Neither the time nor means were at hand to make a canvas of\\r\\nthe cities. While only 27 fatalities are here recorded, some of which\\r\\nare not clearly proven, it is believed that were the figures from the\\r\\ncities obtainable, possible errors in the list would be more than\\r\\noffset and enough reported to swell the total to the number given.\\r\\n\\r\\n(2) In addition to the deaths an appalling trail of illness has\\r\\nfollowed vaccination. It has been entirely beyond the scope of this\\r\\npublication to print even a partial record of these cases.\\r\\n\\r\\n(3) The cost in illness and destruction of child life is entirely\\r\\nout of proportion to the amount of protection against smallpox that\\r\\nis attained or needed. There were but three deaths from smallpox in\\r\\nthe entire State, including Greater New York, in 1914. In one rural\\r\\ndistrict twenty miles in diameter, where four children died from\\r\\nvaccination, there has not been a single case of smallpox within the\\r\\nmemory of any person now living.\\r\\n\\r\\n(4) Vaccination of children is wrong in principle, is not in harmony\\r\\nwith the trend of the best medical practice and should be abandoned.\\r\\nIt is being more clearly understood every day that many of the serious\\r\\nills of later years are directly traceable to the so-called children’s\\r\\ndiseases. Whereas the tendency was once to encourage the having of\\r\\nsuch diseases so as to “have them over with,” the tendency now is to\\r\\nkeep the child just as free from them as can be, and postpone them to\\r\\nas late an age as possible. A normal vaccination is as serious as some\\r\\nof the diseases of childhood, without taking into further account its\\r\\nsinister possibilities.\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\n    _Note._ I have a few hundred copies of Mr. Loyster’s valuable\\r\\n    pamphlet now in hand, and can furnish full copies, on request,\\r\\n    for ten cents each to cover cost and postage.

But a short\\r\\n    time after her arm got better she got malignant scarlet fever,\\r\\n    and in twenty-four hours she was gone. I shall always lay it\\r\\n    to the vaccination. I hope the time will come when the Health\\r\\n    Board will see the mistake and allow children to go to school\\r\\n    without having that vile stuff put in their healthy bodies.

There are many deaths caused by vaccination and the\\r\\n    blame placed on something else. For instance, my boy James\\r\\n    was vaccinated in Chicago some years ago. He was eight years\\r\\n    of age. A week after the vaccination his feet and limbs began\\r\\n    to swell and pain him. Then he took so sick that I called in\\r\\n    Chicago’s most noted physicians and specialists to consult on\\r\\n    the case. They dosed, anointed, injected and did many things\\r\\n    trying to counteract the poison, but all to no avail. The\\r\\n    blessed, innocent little boy suffered the tortures of the\\r\\n    damned; he wasted away and died in horrible agony. The doctor\\r\\n    made out his death certificate, giving the case as “heart\\r\\n    failure.” Now I have another boy eight years of age and I will\\r\\n    go through hell before I will suffer him to have the matter\\r\\n    taken from a festering sore of a cow and injected into his\\r\\n    blood. What course must I pursue to defeat vaccination in this\\r\\n    case?--Mr. O., New York City, Sept. 5, 1914.\\r\\n\\r\\n    _No. 6._ I have a little boy eight years old. When he was four\\r\\n    I found I had to have him vaccinated. I took him to my mother’s\\r\\n    family doctor. He had been our doctor for forty years and\\r\\n    always had great faith in him, and he vaccinated my little boy\\r\\n    who was very strong and healthy. It went into blood poison, his\\r\\n    little arm was so big and swollen, he got feverish and sick and\\r\\n    our doctor was there every day for about a month and he was\\r\\n    not getting any better and finally he told me I had better get\\r\\n    another doctor, that he could do no more and my boy was getting\\r\\n    very bad. I went and got a special doctor. He ordered my boy\\r\\n    taken to a hospital, and there he was, did not know what minute\\r\\n    they would have to cut his little arm off to save his life and\\r\\n    so sick did not know what minute he might die. I don’t know\\r\\n    of any sickness that would be worse than that was. I cannot\\r\\n    describe it in a letter, and ever since he has not been well,\\r\\n    he is so thin and pale and gets tired so easy. I know it is all\\r\\n    on account of that vaccination and now I have two little girls,\\r\\n    twins two years old. I don’t know what I would do if I had to\\r\\n    have them vaccinated, which is indeed barbarous. I do not wish\\r\\n    to see any one vaccinated again and suffer as my little boy\\r\\n    did, his arm is thinner and weaker than the other one is.

J., Oct. 7, 1915.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo this last letter the following answer was sent:\\r\\n\\r\\n    Dear Sir: I thank you very much for your kind letter of\\r\\n    Oct. 7th, giving me particulars as to the death of your two\\r\\n    precious little boys from lockjaw caused by vaccination, and I\\r\\n    hardly know how to express my horror at this misfortune and\\r\\n    my sympathy with you in what, as you say, was an “entirely\\r\\n    unnecessary operation forced upon the people”: but I have\\r\\n    now determined, from a knowledge of a large number of cases\\r\\n    like yours, which are occurring all over the country, to do\\r\\n    everything I can for the balance of my life to bring about the\\r\\n    repeal and prohibition of all compulsory vaccination in every\\r\\n    shape and form as nothing less than a medical crime on the\\r\\n    people. Within the last week three children have been killed in\\r\\n    our own city from this evil.\\r\\n\\r\\n    I have spent fully twenty-five thousand dollars in the last\\r\\n    year in a newspaper campaign in our State to enlighten the\\r\\n    people as to the great falsehoods and fatalities of compulsory\\r\\n    vaccination and to bring about the repeal of the law, but the\\r\\n    medical powers in the State, which profit by vaccination, had\\r\\n    too much influence in the legislature and the law was only\\r\\n    slightly altered, so as to take compulsory vaccination off the\\r\\n    country districts and put it stronger on the ten large cities\\r\\n    in the State where the enforcement of the law will be more\\r\\n    profitable to the vaccinators. This new law is, however, so bad\\r\\n    and illegal that I think it can be easily invalidated in our\\r\\n    courts, and I shall continue to fight it until it is completely\\r\\n    removed from our statute books as one of the greatest outrages\\r\\n    on children ever committed by man.\\r\\n\\r\\n    I believe that a special act should be passed by our\\r\\n    legislatures to indemnify all parents whose children have been\\r\\n    killed by these dangerous and unnecessary medical operations\\r\\n    forced upon the people by an unwise law, and I will endeavor to\\r\\n    have such an act introduced in our State at the next session of\\r\\n    our legislature and would suggest that you propose a similar\\r\\n    law in your own State.\\r\\n\\r\\n  (Signed) CHAS. M. HIGGINS.\\r\\n  Brooklyn, N. Y., Oct. 14, 1915.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLETTER FROM AN AGGRIEVED FATHER ON THE DEATH OF HIS LITTLE BOY FROM\\r\\nVACCINATION\\r\\n\\r\\n  4913 Church Avenue, Flatbush,\\r\\n  Brooklyn, N. Y., July 27, 1915.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Hon. ELIHU ROOT,\\r\\n  President Constitutional Convention,\\r\\n  Albany, N. Y.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Sir:\\r\\n\\r\\n    On October 16, 1914, I was compelled by the Board of Education\\r\\n    of New York to have my son, Chester Stanley Waters, vaccinated\\r\\n    as a condition to enter school.\\r\\n\\r\\n    The operation was performed by a Board of Health Doctor in\\r\\n    Public School No. 135, Flatbush, Brooklyn, on that date.\\r\\n\\r\\n    On November 8, 1914, my son was taken sick with Tetanus, a\\r\\n    direct result of that compulsory vaccination.\\r\\n\\r\\n    I called in our family physician, Dr. A. R. Addy, 208 Lenox\\r\\n    Road, Flatbush, who examined my boy, found a large vaccination\\r\\n    wound containing a very considerable quantity of pus. Having\\r\\n    removed this and cauterized the wound, diagnosed the case\\r\\n    as Tetanus and advised his immediate removal to Kings Co.\\r\\n    Hospital, which was done.\\r\\n\\r\\n    He died in Hospital on November 14, 1914, inflicting upon me a\\r\\n    punishment beyond words to describe.\\r\\n\\r\\n    A poison of the most vile kind was injected into the pure,\\r\\n    clean blood of my beautiful, healthy little boy (seven years\\r\\n    of age), destroying his young life, bringing death to him in a\\r\\n    most horrible manner.\\r\\n\\r\\n    I learn you are engaged on an Amendment to the Constitution\\r\\n    to remove compulsory vaccination as a condition to enter\\r\\n    school and receive education, and I would most earnestly urge\\r\\n    you to adopt such an Amendment. My boy was killed by the\\r\\n    enforced vaccination, killed as a condition for exercising his\\r\\n    _inalienable right to receive education_.\\r\\n\\r\\n    I appeal to you, myself, a stricken father, punished beyond\\r\\n    description, to save other fathers and mothers from such an\\r\\n    awful fate as has been inflicted upon me.\\r\\n\\r\\n    Trusting God will guide you and your associates, engaged in\\r\\n    this work, to see the frightfulness and utter uselessness of\\r\\n    this abominable law and adopt an Amendment sufficiently strong\\r\\n    in our State Constitution to wipe it out forever.\\r\\n\\r\\n    Protect our children!\\r\\n\\r\\n  Yours very respectfully,\\r\\n  (Signed) R. C. WATERS.\\r\\n\\r\\n    _Note._ The Convention failed to adopt any Amendment concerning\\r\\n    vaccination, and all the Amendments which it did recommend were\\r\\n    defeated by popular vote at the next election.--C. M. H.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPROPOSED LAW TO COMPENSATE PARENTS FOR INJURY TO OR DEATH OF VACCINATED\\r\\nCHILDREN\\r\\n\\r\\nAs suggested in a previous page, there should be a special act passed\\r\\nby every State, which now requires compulsory vaccination in any form,\\r\\nto indemnify parents or relatives for any injury or death caused by\\r\\nvaccination forced on children or other victims by such unwise law\\r\\nas requires the general infliction of a compulsory disease upon the\\r\\npeople. This law has been originated by medical dogmatism and is\\r\\ncontinued by medical interest and falsehood, as already shown, and is\\r\\nof great actual profit to doctors and virus makers, but is truly “A\\r\\nMenace to the State.” On this point see the Statue of Wisdom and Law\\r\\nin the frontispiece, with its wise motto which stands as a distinct\\r\\nrebuke to this evil law which either should be repealed or compensated\\r\\nby a remedial act passed for the relief of its many victims as here\\r\\nsuggested, for, surely, “Every Law not Based on Wisdom is a Menace to\\r\\nthe State.”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSHOCKING MEDICAL MENDACITY, ON THE ALLEGED HARMLESSNESS OF VACCINATION\\r\\n\\r\\nI might continue here for hundreds of pages to report “ad nauseam”\\r\\nshocking instances of vaccination horrors such as already shown.\\r\\nIndeed, I am not sure but I may have already reached, for the average\\r\\nreader, the point of “ad nauseam” in the many horrible instances now\\r\\nexposed. But I believe I could go on in this exposure to the point “ad\\r\\ninfinitum” if all the deadly results of vaccination could be brought to\\r\\npublic light which are now hermetically concealed by our professionally\\r\\ninterested partisans of vaccination who now control our Departments of\\r\\nHealth and Vital Statistics and can conceal their grave mistakes as\\r\\nthey please.\\r\\n\\r\\nPhysically shocking as are the vaccination horrors which I have already\\r\\nexposed, they are not, morally, so shocking as the awful medical\\r\\nmendacity or ignorance and presumption which constantly asserts the\\r\\nperfect harmlessness of vaccination and denies its responsibility for\\r\\nfrequent disastrous effects on human health and life.\\r\\n\\r\\nI will now give some examples of this gross medical mendacity from\\r\\nsome of the so-called high medical authorities as found in Government\\r\\nReports, Health Department Bulletins, leading Encyclopedias and Medical\\r\\nBooks in this country and England which will clearly illustrate my\\r\\nserious charge and show that, usually, the higher the alleged authority\\r\\nis, the more false and exaggerated his statements are, and the more\\r\\neasily refuted, as I will soon prove.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PHILIPPINE FALSEHOOD\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is one Government Report on vaccination in the Philippine\\r\\nIslands, which is often quoted by vaccinators to show the utter\\r\\nharmlessness of vaccination, which claims that from three to five\\r\\nmillions of vaccinations have been performed on the population of the\\r\\nPhilippines, _without a single injury or death_! Now, this reckless\\r\\nreport might be made correct if slightly amended by the Goddess of\\r\\nTruth to read as follows: “Three to five millions vaccinated without a\\r\\nsingle injury or death”--_which has ever been honestly acknowledged_!\\r\\nIt is, of course, shamefully false on its face to say that three to\\r\\nfive millions of vaccinations were ever inflicted in the Philippines\\r\\nor anywhere else without any injuries or deaths; and the mind which\\r\\ncan accept such a statement without a big logical and moral squirm\\r\\ndoes not understand the real nature of vaccination, the facts of vital\\r\\nstatistics, or the first principles of mere mathematical chances,\\r\\nproportions and probabilities, as I will now show.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the first place, a million is such a gigantic number that any person\\r\\nwho has any disrespect for or trifles with it is not fit to discuss\\r\\nthis subject. For example: if a man were to live for a million days he\\r\\nwould have to be about three thousand years old! Whereas the average\\r\\nlife of a man is much less than fifty years or about one-sixtieth of\\r\\na million days! Now, if a man were to subject himself for the whole\\r\\naverage lifetime of fifty years, or one-sixtieth of a million days,\\r\\nto the ordinary, benign, and necessary conditions of breathing air,\\r\\ndrinking water and milk and eating food, he could not possibly do\\r\\nthis without at some time contracting some disease and possible death\\r\\nfrom these perfectly normal, necessary, and benign conditions of\\r\\nbreathing, eating and drinking, as most of our diseases and infections\\r\\nare admittedly contracted through these three benign sources! Yet our\\r\\nGovernment-trifler in millions wants us to believe that you could\\r\\ninflict on the human body--millions of times--not a purely benign\\r\\naction, but the purely and doubly malign act of vaccination, which\\r\\nconsists in first wounding the body and then injecting into this wound\\r\\na virulent septicemic infection, without causing a single injury or\\r\\ndeath! In other words, the doubly malign act--wounding and infecting\\r\\nthe human body with a complex pus infection--is utterly harmless and\\r\\nless injurious than the purely benign acts of breathing, eating and\\r\\ndrinking, which demonstrably cannot be practised for one-sixtieth of a\\r\\nmillion days by any human being without a possible serious injury or\\r\\ndeath!\\r\\n\\r\\nHere is surely the “reductio ad absurdum” which shows that such a\\r\\nreckless statement of the harmlessness of vaccination by the millions\\r\\nis, of course, a stupid and shameful medical falsehood on its face\\r\\nand is pretty close to being a medical crime on the people, as any\\r\\nhonest doctor or intelligent layman must know who has given any serious\\r\\nconsideration to this subject, or who has any idea of what vaccination\\r\\nis, or who knows anything of disease infections, vital statistics and\\r\\nthe laws of mere mathematical chances and probabilities.\\r\\n\\r\\nIndeed, every competent doctor knows that you could not subject the\\r\\nhuman body to a mere pin scratch for a million times without causing\\r\\nseveral serious injuries or possible deaths from resulting infections.\\r\\nAnd every competent doctor and student of vital statistics knows\\r\\nalso that there are actually more deaths caused every year by mere\\r\\npin scratches and trifling cuts, wounds and abrasions, resulting in\\r\\nlockjaw, septicemia, erysipelas and other infections than from the\\r\\ndreaded smallpox itself.\\r\\n\\r\\nIs it not, therefore, rather strange, Mr. President, that vaccination\\r\\nshould be reported as so utterly harmless in the distant Philippines,\\r\\nwhere we can not easily get at the records, when we know it is so\\r\\ndeadly in the near-by England and America, where the accessible\\r\\nrecords show that it causes, frequently, more deaths than smallpox,\\r\\nas I have already proved? For example: the great English Commission\\r\\non Vaccination found that deaths from vaccination were sometimes as\\r\\nhigh as seventy deaths per million vaccinated. This is twice as high\\r\\nas the mortality from smallpox in the United States, which for five\\r\\nyears, from 1901 to 1905, including our last great epidemic period of\\r\\n1901 and 1902, averaged only thirty-four deaths per million population!\\r\\nSee U. S. Mortality Statistics for 1907, page 40. The Reports of the\\r\\nRegistrar General of England for 1906, 1907 and 1908 give a death-rate\\r\\nfrom infantile vaccination in those years which runs as high as\\r\\nforty-two deaths per million children vaccinated! Here we see that,\\r\\naccording to some of our highest statistical authorities, vaccination\\r\\nis not harmless, but is so very harmful that its ratio of mortality per\\r\\nmillion vaccinated is sometimes twice as great as the ratio of smallpox\\r\\nmortality per million population, and including an epidemic period!\\r\\n\\r\\nWe therefore think, Mr. President, that these points and facts make\\r\\nsufficient answer to, and refutation of, the shocking medical lie that\\r\\nvaccination is perfectly harmless, and, per contra, prove that general\\r\\nvaccination is actually more dangerous to public health and human life\\r\\nto-day than natural smallpox, just as that great medical blunder of a\\r\\npast century--smallpox inoculation--was proved to be more dangerous\\r\\nthan the natural disease and was finally prohibited by penal law. And I\\r\\nfeel sure that compulsory vaccination will follow the same course and\\r\\nbe legally prohibited for the same reason in the present century.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHEALTH DEPARTMENT FALSEHOODS\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a lifelong student of this subject I have become convinced that the\\r\\nwhole cult and practice of general public vaccination and particularly\\r\\nall compulsory vaccination, like all great intrenched evils, has\\r\\noriginated in falsehood, has continued in falsehood, and now exists\\r\\non both falsehood and concealment, viz.: falsehood as to its absolute\\r\\nefficiency and certainty in protecting the individual against smallpox;\\r\\nfalsehood as to the necessity of general vaccination to prevent\\r\\nsmallpox epidemics; and gross falsehood as to its perfect safety and\\r\\nfreedom from danger to human health and life.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, I do not think that I have ever seen a grosser illustration of\\r\\nthe truth of this charge than can be found in the special article on\\r\\nVaccination published in the _Monthly Bulletin_ or _Health News_ for\\r\\nFebruary, 1914, issued by the New York State Department of Health\\r\\nat Albany, which contains what I believe to be shocking falsehoods,\\r\\nfallacies, and exaggerations which even a tyro in the investigation\\r\\nof this subject could easily refute, as I will now show. All these\\r\\nfallacies have been issued with an air of gospel truth, to instruct the\\r\\npublic, and to try to justify the extreme efforts of our department\\r\\nofficers and medical doctors to force compulsory vaccination on\\r\\nevery child and adult in this State as not only absolutely necessary\\r\\nfor public health, but as the only known means to prevent smallpox\\r\\nepidemics, and as being an operation which is wholly beneficial and\\r\\nentirely safe and harmless to human health and life. I shall now give\\r\\nexamples of the chief and worst of these medical falsehoods and follow\\r\\nwith their refutation, as a duty clearly due to public truth and right.\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST FALSEHOOD: This official Bulletin at page 48 tells us concerning\\r\\nthe alleged efficiency and necessity of vaccination as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n    “Nothing but vaccination can save from smallpox.... Cleanliness\\r\\n    and general sanitation exert absolutely no influence upon its\\r\\n    prevalence.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is about as shocking, absurd and false as it can be, and coming\\r\\nfrom our highest State health officer is certainly not creditable to\\r\\nour public health service, but is so obviously absurd and untenable\\r\\nas to refute itself on its very face. This paragraph tells us, in\\r\\neffect, that dense human overcrowding, with personal and public filth\\r\\nspread everywhere, no sanitation or isolation anywhere, and every case\\r\\nof smallpox left loose and at large to spread by direct contact to\\r\\nevery child and adult and thus infect every one right and left, as in\\r\\nthe old unsanitary times of big and frequent epidemics--all this, our\\r\\nHealth Commissioner coolly tells us, would not make a bit of difference\\r\\nin the spread of the disease! And, per contra, the prevention of all\\r\\nthese vile unsanitary conditions of barbarous times, with or without\\r\\nvaccination, would have no effect whatever to reduce the disease!\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, of course, every person of any common sense or knowledge simply\\r\\nknows that these propositions are absurdly false on their face, and\\r\\nthat we need pay no further attention to them, except to show by such\\r\\nhorrible examples how foolish and desperate the falsehoods are that\\r\\nare resorted to by some doctors and health officers to try to force\\r\\nthis dangerous medical evil of compulsory disease on every child and\\r\\nadult, and that on such falsehoods it is essentially based. Every\\r\\nunbiased student of this subject knows that efficient sanitation and\\r\\nhygiene have been the most effectual means for preventing and reducing\\r\\nall diseases and promoting public health during the last half century\\r\\nand that, as a matter of fact, no serious reduction of smallpox or\\r\\ntyphoid fever has been effected in modern times except through general\\r\\nsanitation and hygiene, with or without vaccination.\\r\\n\\r\\nSECOND FALSEHOOD: The next major fallacy in this State Department\\r\\nBulletin relates to the alleged perfect safety of vaccination, as\\r\\nfollows:\\r\\n\\r\\n    “There is not the slightest risk in the process of vaccination\\r\\n    when it is carried out with clean virus (now guaranteed by\\r\\n    Government inspection) and when the vaccination itself is kept\\r\\n    clean. ‘Sore arms’ come from dirt getting into the vaccination,\\r\\n    not from the vaccine itself.”\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, if the man who wrote this falsehood knows anything extensive on\\r\\nthis subject, he must know that what he states here is not true. And he\\r\\nknows also that the government does not really guarantee any virus, and\\r\\nthat no such thing as “clean” virus is now, or ever was, made or can be\\r\\nmade; that is, no virus without some, or many, dangerous suppurative\\r\\ndisease germs of one kind or another, known or unknown, which will\\r\\nnot be likely, some time or other, in some persons, to bring about\\r\\na dangerous infection of the system with possible serious or fatal\\r\\ninjury, and that, as a matter of fact, such infections are occurring\\r\\nconstantly in children and adults from the various existing brands of\\r\\n“clean,” “inspected,” and “certified” virus now in use. Furthermore, as\\r\\nto this evil being caused only by “dirt” getting into the wound, this\\r\\naudacious writer must also know that this dangerous or fatal infection\\r\\ncan and does come into the wound both directly as a “primary” infection\\r\\nfrom the virus itself, and as a “secondary” infection from “dirt” in\\r\\nor about the wound, and he must know very well, if at all competent\\r\\nto write on this subject for public instruction, that one kind of\\r\\ninfection is about as common and as fatal as the other, and that both\\r\\nare almost equally chargeable to the operation of vaccination itself,\\r\\nso that to contend otherwise is merely a cowardly evasion of the truth,\\r\\nas has been fully proved by the shocking exhibits of vaccination\\r\\nhorrors shown herein.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFALSEHOODS FROM THE ENCYCLOPEDIAS\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the article on Vaccination in one of our leading American books of\\r\\nreference, the “International Encyclopedia,” published by Dodd, Mead &\\r\\nCo. in 1904, I take this surprising gem of falsehood, as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n    “_There is absolutely no danger of transmitting disease by\\r\\n    means of bovine virus._”\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease note that the author of this falsehood is not content with\\r\\nsaying merely that there is _no danger_, but _absolutely_ no danger.\\r\\nAnd when he was asked for an explanation or “authority” for this\\r\\noutrageous statement, this is what he answered:\\r\\n\\r\\n    “You ask for the authority for the statement in the\\r\\n    International Encyclopedia: ‘There is absolutely no danger of\\r\\n    transmitting disease by means of bovine virus.’\\r\\n\\r\\n    “I cannot refer you to an authoritative work on medicine where\\r\\n    this statement can be found, but it is commonly repeated by\\r\\n    professors of medicine to students, and was put away in my\\r\\n    memory as an established fact many years ago.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rank stupidity and falsity of the statement first quoted will\\r\\nbe evident when we recite the fact that _the very basic purpose and\\r\\nfunction_ of the bovine virus is _to transmit the disease cow-smallpox\\r\\nfrom calves to man_, as an alleged preventive of another disease,\\r\\nnatural smallpox, and yet this high medical authority, writing for\\r\\nthe information of the trusting public in one of our leading books\\r\\nof reference, solemnly tells us that it is absolutely impossible to\\r\\ntransmit any disease by it, and that this doctrine has been preached\\r\\nto students for years _as an established fact_! If, however, he meant\\r\\nto say that it is absolutely impossible to transmit any other disease\\r\\nbesides cow-smallpox or “vaccinia,” this statement would, of course,\\r\\nbe equally false. Even of such generally harmless and benign mediums\\r\\nas _air_, _water_ and _milk_, it could not be sanely or truthfully\\r\\nsaid by any one that “_there is absolutely no danger of transmitting\\r\\ndisease_” by them, for we all know that some of the most common and\\r\\nfatal diseases are often transmitted by these very benign mediums,\\r\\nair, water and milk. But to make such a reckless statement about a\\r\\ndangerous complicated _disease culture or virus_, a revolting _extract\\r\\nof pustules_, is not only grossly _untruthful_, but it is hardly even\\r\\n_sane_; yet this is a good sample of some of the statements with which\\r\\nour _high medical authorities_ have misled the trusting public mind.\\r\\nAnd speaking of “sanity,” it may provide us with a rather laughable\\r\\nemotion, at this point in our very grave subject, if I now cite the\\r\\nfact that at the time this high medical authority made this most false\\r\\nand absurd statement, as to the utter harmlessness of vaccination, he\\r\\nactually held the most high and significant office of--“_President of\\r\\nthe New York State Commission on Lunacy_”!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE ERRORS IN THE BRITANNICA\\r\\n\\r\\nThe article on Vaccination in the Encyclopedia Britannica, in the old\\r\\nedition preceding the last or current edition, was written by Dr.\\r\\nChas. Creighton of London, a well known English doctor who, by long\\r\\nstudy, has become an opponent of vaccination, and is the author of\\r\\nseveral books exposing its fallacies. When Dr. Creighton first got\\r\\nthe commission to write the article for the Encyclopedia he was a\\r\\npro-vaccinist, like many other doctors, but to fit himself to write\\r\\na full and impartial article which would give both sides of the\\r\\nsubject he resolved to make a thorough study of it, pro and con. This\\r\\nstudy convinced him of the dangerous nature of vaccination to health\\r\\nand life, its limited or exaggerated value as a protection against\\r\\nsmallpox, and its illogical or unscientific basis as a medical remedy;\\r\\nand his critical article on this subject, when it first appeared in the\\r\\nleading Encyclopedia, made a sensation in the medical world and has\\r\\nbeen a thorn in the side of pro-vaccinists ever since.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, what will impartial students of this subject say when I cite the\\r\\nfact that the article on Vaccination in the last or current edition\\r\\nof the Britannica is written, not by a man who is impartial and\\r\\nprofessionally disinterested in the subject, as was Dr. Creighton,\\r\\nand who tried to give both sides of the subject freely, but, on the\\r\\ncontrary, by a man who is actually _a manufacturer or inventor of\\r\\nvaccine virus_ and has, therefore, necessarily, a professional interest\\r\\nand bias to conceal the failures and dangers of vaccination as far\\r\\nas he can? Surely, the editors of the Britannica made a great moral\\r\\nand logical mistake when they selected any man to write so important\\r\\nan article on a much disputed subject in this great book of reference\\r\\nwho had any professional or other interest or bias in this subject.\\r\\nNow, the biased and interested author of this article in the last\\r\\nedition is none other than Dr. S. Monckton Copeman of London, a strong\\r\\npro-vaccinist, who claims to be the original inventor of the so-called\\r\\n“_glycerinated virus_” now in general use for vaccination. The idea of\\r\\nadding glycerine to the virus is to kill the many dangerous disease\\r\\ngerms or infections it is known to contain, but to preserve the germ\\r\\nof smallpox, or “cowpox” intact. This is, of course, an admission that\\r\\nbefore the use of glycerinated virus vaccination was very dangerous\\r\\nand likely to cause many infections in the human body, but since the\\r\\nadoption of glycerinated virus--Dr. Copeman’s invention--it is now\\r\\nclaimed that vaccination is rendered safe and harmless. This is, of\\r\\ncourse, a false claim, as I have already shown, and will further show\\r\\nin a succeeding paragraph.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, this greatly biased and one-sided article of Dr. Copeman--the\\r\\nmaker or inventor of glycerinated virus--in our greatest Encyclopedia,\\r\\nis surely a good illustration of my charge that the trusting public\\r\\nmind is constantly misled, whether intentionally or unintentionally\\r\\nI know not, by some of our highest medical authorities on the\\r\\nwhole subject of vaccination, and particularly as to its alleged\\r\\nharmlessness. Thus, when Dr. Copeman, who is regarded as one of the\\r\\nleading authorities on modern vaccination, comes to consider the\\r\\ndangers of vaccination, he heads his paragraph, “Alleged Injurious\\r\\nEffects,” thus implying that the injuries are only “alleged” and not\\r\\nreal, and he goes on to argue or imply that--due to his invention--the\\r\\ndangers and injuries are now trifling or negligible, but tacitly admits\\r\\nor implies that before his invention of glycerinated virus the dangers\\r\\nwere very serious, whereas, with his invention, vaccination is now\\r\\npractically safe and harmless.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, what must we think of the truth of this claim that vaccination\\r\\nwith glycerinated virus is now safe and harmless, when, at the very\\r\\ntime that its inventor made or implied this claim in the pages of the\\r\\nEncyclopedia, in the year 1910 or 1911, the vital records of his own\\r\\ncountry, in the reports of the Registrar General of England for those\\r\\ntwo years, showed that there were eight deaths from vaccination in the\\r\\nyear 1910, and fourteen deaths from vaccination in 1911! And these\\r\\nfatal vaccinations were, of course, all made with the glycerinated\\r\\nvirus as, practically, no other kind is now used! These vaccination\\r\\ndeaths were all in little children under five years and they exceeded\\r\\nthe deaths from smallpox in the same age class by fourfold in 1910 and\\r\\nby threefold in 1911! That is, the deaths from vaccination under five\\r\\nyears were eight in 1910 and fourteen in 1911; while the deaths from\\r\\nsmallpox under five years were two in 1910 and five in 1911! The total\\r\\ndeaths from smallpox in all ages were nineteen in 1910 and twenty-three\\r\\nin 1911.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe four years preceding 1910 show even a worse record for vaccinal\\r\\nmortality than the record of 1910 and 1911, so that the record of\\r\\nthose two years cannot be claimed as anything special or unusual.\\r\\nFor example, the reports of the Registrar General for 1906, 1907\\r\\nand 1908 show a total of only six deaths for these three years\\r\\nfrom smallpox in the infant ages under five years--the ages most\\r\\nsusceptible to smallpox--while for the same infant ages there is a\\r\\ntotal of fifty-three deaths for the same three years from cowpox or\\r\\nvaccination--nine times more infant deaths from vaccination than from\\r\\nsmallpox! In 1909 there is reported only one infant death from smallpox\\r\\nand eleven infant deaths from vaccination!\\r\\n\\r\\nThis shocking record of vaccination deaths clearly shows that the\\r\\nfamous glycerinated vaccination of Dr. Copeman, which he virtually\\r\\nclaims to be so safe and harmless, in our greatest book of public\\r\\nreference, is actually from three to ten times more fatal to children\\r\\nthan natural smallpox, as proved by the vital records of his own\\r\\ncountry and by the highest statistical authority in the world! Surely,\\r\\nMr. President, in such crushing counter facts as these, my charge\\r\\nof a shocking deception of the public mind, either intentional or\\r\\nunintentional, on the merits of vaccination by our highest medical and\\r\\nliterary authorities, is flatly proved.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE ERRORS OF DR. M. J. ROSENAU, A HIGH MEDICAL AUTHORITY, ON THE\\r\\nRELATIVE HARMLESSNESS OF VACCINATION\\r\\n\\r\\nWe now come to a different style of medical falsehood on the effects\\r\\nof vaccination which, while honestly admitting its dangerous nature,\\r\\nyet tries to minimize the dangers as much as possible and reduce them\\r\\nto the relatively immaterial. This is a shameful equivocation of the\\r\\ntruth and an absurd contradiction of facts, as I will now prove out\\r\\nof the mouth of the apologist himself. I now refer to the statements\\r\\nof Dr. Milton J. Rosenau, who is one of our highest authorities in\\r\\nthis country on vaccination and other special medical subjects. He was\\r\\nfor several years Director of the United States Hygienic Laboratory\\r\\nat Washington, where he made many investigations into the nature of\\r\\nvaccine virus, its impurities, dangers, etc., and has made official\\r\\nreports on different subjects for the said Laboratory and for the\\r\\nUnited States Public Health Service. He is now professor of Preventive\\r\\nMedicine and Hygiene in Harvard University, and is the author of\\r\\nseveral books, one of which, “Preventive Medicine and Hygiene,”\\r\\npublished by D. Appleton & Co. in 1914, I will now quote from. In this\\r\\nbook, on page 19, under the head of “Dangers and Complications” of\\r\\nvaccination, Dr. Rosenau states as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n    “However, vaccination is not always a harmless procedure; it\\r\\n    must be looked upon as the production of an acute infectious\\r\\n    disease, and, although the disease is always mild and trivial,\\r\\n    it must not be treated as trifling. The chief danger lies in\\r\\n    the fact that we have produced an open wound, which is subject\\r\\n    to the complications of any wound. Even a pin prick or a razor\\r\\n    scratch may result in death. While the aggregate number of\\r\\n    deaths resulting from the complications of vaccination may be\\r\\n    considerable, the aggregate of the individual risk is so small\\r\\n    as to be disregarded, especially when proper precautions are\\r\\n    taken.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHere, surely, are some honest admissions and some queer denials, and\\r\\nI would now kindly ask you, Mr. President, to re-read this quotation\\r\\ncarefully, and I think you will find it an interesting verbal and\\r\\npsychological study, showing the typical sophistry and casuistry of\\r\\nthe whole vaccination cult which well illustrates a witty saying of\\r\\nthe late Elbert Hubbard, who was a great student and opponent of\\r\\nvaccination, viz.: “The great trouble with vaccination is that it\\r\\nvaccinates the mind.” And he meant by this that the poison which the\\r\\nvaccinators put into the blood of their victims seems to react morally\\r\\non themselves so that it poisons and blinds their minds and renders\\r\\nthem unable to see their own shocking absurdities and mendacities in\\r\\ntheir false excuses and defences for the serious evils of vaccination.\\r\\nThe great Gladstone was reported to have said that he was led to\\r\\noppose compulsory vaccination not so much by the arguments of the\\r\\nanti-vaccinists as from the falsehoods of the vaccinators.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou will note that all the medical authorities previously quoted assert\\r\\npositively that vaccination is perfectly safe and harmless and never\\r\\ncauses any serious injury or death, except what might be due to the\\r\\ncarelessness of the vaccinated persons themselves, which statement I\\r\\nhave proved by overwhelming evidence to be a most outrageous medical\\r\\nfalsehood. Per contra, the last medical authority quoted honestly\\r\\nadmits that vaccination is not always harmless and that it always\\r\\nconsists in inflicting an acute infectious disease on the human body,\\r\\nbut that this inflicted disease practically never does any harm and may\\r\\nbe disregarded. In other words, the policy of this medical authority\\r\\nand high representative of the vaccination cult, in the statement\\r\\nquoted, seems to be to honestly admit all he dare, and gracefully deny\\r\\nall he can! And for this honesty we must give him a layman’s thanks,\\r\\nfor he does really admit a great deal, and where he attempts to deny he\\r\\nreally admits more, as I will soon show.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, it is obvious that the infliction of “an acute infectious\\r\\ndisease,” deliberately and extensively, on the human body, is a\\r\\nvicious and dangerous practice, per se and prima facie, and cannot\\r\\nbe continued indefinitely without serious injuries, as I have already\\r\\nproved, and hence Dr. Rosenau contradicts himself at the very outset\\r\\nin his statement or apology for vaccination. In his next phrase he\\r\\nmakes the still more surprising statement that this inflicted disease\\r\\nis “_always mild and trivial_,” which assertion is undoubtedly a\\r\\nfalsehood! And Dr. Rosenau must know as well as any doctor or layman\\r\\nin this country that this assertion is false, and per contra that this\\r\\ninflicted disease--vaccination--is sometimes very severe and fatal and\\r\\nfar worse than natural smallpox itself, and that it often causes more\\r\\nannual deaths than smallpox, as I have already proved by overwhelming\\r\\nevidence and by the highest statistical records in the world! I would,\\r\\ntherefore, here respectfully suggest that Dr. Rosenau make some\\r\\napology to his readers for this falsehood or mistake, and correct this\\r\\nstatement as soon as possible in the next edition of his book.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo emphasize and dispose of this serious error of Dr. Rosenau I will\\r\\nnow show out of his own mouth how he stultifies and contradicts\\r\\nhimself, and logically admits that vaccination is not “always mild and\\r\\ntrivial,” but is often quite dangerous and fatal. For example, he says:\\r\\n\\r\\n    “And although the disease is always mild and trivial, yet it\\r\\n    must not be treated as trifling.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThis phrase, just quoted, is, surely, a rich verbal and logical study\\r\\nof medical sophistry and equivocation. Vaccination, this medical\\r\\nchampion tells us, is always a “trivial” disease, but it is not a\\r\\n“trifling” disease. This is morally and logically equivalent to\\r\\ntelling us that vaccination _is trivial_ and it _is not trivial_! In\\r\\nother words, he asserts in one breath what he denies in the next, or\\r\\ncontradicts himself in successive breaths! This is so, because the\\r\\ndictionaries show that the two words “trifling” and “trivial” have\\r\\nexactly the same meaning and are synonymous and identical, so that\\r\\n“trivial” is defined as “trifling,” and “trifling” is defined as\\r\\n“trivial.” This, therefore, morally and logically, means a confession\\r\\nout of his own mouth that the inflicted disease, vaccination, is not\\r\\nalways either trivial or trifling, but is often very dangerous and\\r\\ndeadly, which is, of course, the exact and demonstrable truth, and the\\r\\nscholarly Dr. Rosenau is the last man who can plead ignorance of this\\r\\ntruth. Indeed, in another paragraph of his contradictory statement,\\r\\nhe absolutely acknowledges this serious danger of vaccination while\\r\\napparently trying to conceal or deny it. For example, he makes this\\r\\nconclusive and crushing admission that:\\r\\n\\r\\n    “While the aggregate number of deaths resulting from the\\r\\n    complications of vaccination may be considerable, the aggregate\\r\\n    of the individual risk is so small as to be disregarded.”\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, if the aggregate number of deaths from vaccination is\\r\\n“_considerable_,” then it is clearly proved, out of his own mouth,\\r\\nthat vaccination is not always mild or trivial, but just the opposite,\\r\\nviz., _frequently very dangerous and deadly_, thus again proving the\\r\\ncase against vaccination out of the mouth of its own defenders! As to\\r\\nthe quibble or sophistry that “_the aggregate of the individual risk is\\r\\nso small as to be disregarded_,” this is also a fallacy and falsehood,\\r\\nbecause this cannot be really true if the aggregate number of deaths\\r\\nis so “considerable,” and particularly not when we have shown that the\\r\\ndeaths from vaccination frequently exceed the deaths from smallpox, as\\r\\nthis proves that the individual risk from general vaccination is far\\r\\ngreater than from natural smallpox, and, therefore, in the long run,\\r\\nvaccination is as much to be avoided as smallpox if not more so.\\r\\n\\r\\nWebster’s Dictionary gives three meanings for “Considerable,” as\\r\\nfollows: “Worthy of consideration”; “notable”; “rather large in amount.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Comprehensive Standard Dictionary gives the meaning of\\r\\n“Considerable” as: “Of noteworthy size, quantity or importance.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIt will therefore be seen that Dr. Rosenau, necessarily and logically,\\r\\nadmits that the deaths and injuries from vaccination are not “trivial”\\r\\nbut “rather large in amount,” and “of noteworthy size, quantity or\\r\\nimportance,” thus proving our case out of the mouth of our opponents.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nJENNER’S GREAT FALSEHOODS. THE ORIGINAL MENDACITIES OF VACCINATION\\r\\nEXPOSED\\r\\n\\r\\nNo chapter on the mendacities of vaccination would be complete without\\r\\nincluding the great foundation and monumental falsehoods of Dr. Edward\\r\\nJenner, who was the alleged “discoverer” or inventor of “Vaccination,”\\r\\nby which term is meant the inoculation of cowpox from cow to man and\\r\\nthence from arm to arm, in distinction from the old direct smallpox\\r\\ninoculation from human to human; and it may now be interesting and\\r\\nprofitable to devote a few paragraphs to these great falsehoods of the\\r\\narch-vaccinator himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nJenner’s original claims for vaccination were stated, positively, in\\r\\nhis Petition to Parliament March 17, 1802, asking for a reward for his\\r\\nalleged “discovery” in these words:\\r\\n\\r\\n    “That _your petitioner, having discovered_ that a disease which\\r\\n    occasionally exists in a particular form among cattle, known\\r\\n    by the name of the cowpox, admits of being inoculated on the\\r\\n    human frame with the _most perfect ease_ and _safety_, and is\\r\\n    attended with the singularly beneficial effect of _rendering\\r\\n    through life_ the person so inoculated _perfectly secure from\\r\\n    the infection of the smallpox_.”--See “History and Pathology of\\r\\n    Vaccination,” by Dr. Edgar M. Crookshank, London, 1889, page\\r\\n    173, Vol. I.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, every proposition in the above statement is a shocking falsehood,\\r\\nas can be easily proved by a few moments’ consideration. In the above\\r\\nquotation the emphasis is mine but the words are Jenner’s, and I\\r\\nhave emphasized the words to show clearly where the rank and glaring\\r\\nfalsehoods are which make this short statement a very tissue of\\r\\nfalsehoods, as will soon appear.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the first place, it was a downright falsehood for Jenner to claim\\r\\nthat he had “_discovered_” that a disease known as “cowpox” could be\\r\\ninoculated on the human frame and that this inoculation would act as\\r\\na preventive of smallpox, for it is obvious to every student of the\\r\\nhistory of vaccination that Jenner made no such original “discovery,”\\r\\nbut that this “discovery” was made by the milkmaids and dairy farmers\\r\\nof rural England who had long known and used it, and this “discovery”\\r\\nwas given by them to Jenner, who then falsely claimed it as his own\\r\\n“discovery” and finally got a reward of thirty thousand pounds from\\r\\nParliament for this false claim!\\r\\n\\r\\nThus does History show us that vaccination commenced, at its very\\r\\noutset, with gross falsehood and also in what would be called in our\\r\\nday a gigantic piece of medical “graft,” and it has been continued on a\\r\\nsimilar basis, more or less, ever since.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second great falsehood in the original claim of Jenner was the\\r\\nshocking and reckless statement that the cowpox was perfectly harmless\\r\\nand could be inoculated on the human body with “_perfect safety_,”\\r\\nwhich false claim has been kept up ever since by the mendacious\\r\\nsuccessors of Jenner, as I have already shown. This claim of the\\r\\n“_perfect safety_” of cowpox was, of course, _perfectly false_, for\\r\\nnot only were some of Jenner’s own experiments and tests on patients\\r\\nharmful, but his whole scheme of arm-to-arm vaccination was soon proved\\r\\nto be so dangerous that it was long ago abandoned and prohibited like\\r\\nits evil predecessor--smallpox inoculation--and, for that reason,\\r\\nis not used to-day, being replaced by what is known as “Bovine\\r\\nVaccination,” which is direct inoculation of so-called “cowpox” from\\r\\ncattle to man instead of from man to man or arm to arm as used by\\r\\nJenner. Now, this modern “Bovine” vaccination I believe to be even more\\r\\ndangerous than the old Jennerian arm-to-arm type, because it involves\\r\\nthe extensive diseasing of two classes of animals, cattle and mankind,\\r\\nand has been the cause of deadly epidemics in both classes, as already\\r\\nproved, which was not known under the old system, and it is also guilty\\r\\nof now causing more deaths almost every year than natural smallpox\\r\\nitself, particularly among little children, as I have already proved\\r\\nbeyond question.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe third great falsehood in this tissue of Jennerian mendacity is the\\r\\nclaim that one vaccination rendered the vaccinated person “_perfectly\\r\\nsecure_” “_through life_” from “_the infection of the smallpox_.” This\\r\\nwas, of course, a most reckless and absurd claim on its face, for how\\r\\ncould Jenner, with a few experiments and tests extending over a few\\r\\nyears, declare with any honesty, or with any logical or scientific\\r\\nwarrant, that cowpox inoculation gave _absolute security from smallpox\\r\\nfor life_? This reckless claim was, of course, soon proved to be a\\r\\nrank falsehood by the wide-spread failure of vaccination to protect\\r\\nfrom smallpox as soon as the vaccinated persons were exposed to actual\\r\\ninfection or epidemic conditions where they readily contracted the\\r\\ndisease, as they do to this day notwithstanding their vaccination! A\\r\\nnew apology had therefore to be invented for this wholesale failure\\r\\nof vaccination soon after its first adoption, and this was made by\\r\\nabandoning the false claim of unlimited life protection from one\\r\\nvaccination and substituting the modified claim of a limited protection\\r\\nfor seven years--more or less--and the consequent necessity of frequent\\r\\nor periodical re-vaccinations to get any continued or reliable\\r\\nprotection from the operation.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow Jenner’s original false and absurd claim of unlimited or life\\r\\nprotection from one vaccination was probably partly due to his\\r\\nignorance of the real nature and history of smallpox and his credulous\\r\\nadoption of the old fallacy and superstition, in common use, that one\\r\\nattack of smallpox gave sure immunity for life from a second attack,\\r\\nwhich proposition never really had any scientific basis in theory or\\r\\nfact, as it has been repeatedly proved that smallpox may, and often\\r\\ndoes, occur two or three times in the same person, whether vaccinated\\r\\nor unvaccinated, and that there is no regularity or certainty in the\\r\\nalleged protection given either by smallpox or vaccination, but that\\r\\nimmunity depends largely on sanitary, hygienic and constitutional\\r\\nconditions. In fact, some students seem to think that the person who\\r\\nhas once had smallpox is more likely to have it again than one who has\\r\\nnever had the disease! It was, therefore, at this first demonstrated\\r\\nfailure of vaccination to protect from smallpox that Jenner’s chief\\r\\nassistant, Dr. James Moore, wrote a very interesting little book called\\r\\n“The History of Small Pox,” London, 1815. The chief purpose of this\\r\\nbook was to apologize for the failure of vaccination to protect from\\r\\nsmallpox, as originally falsely claimed by Jenner, by showing that\\r\\neven smallpox does not protect with certainty for life or any other\\r\\nperiod, but that the same person may have smallpox two or three times\\r\\nin succession, instances of which are cited all through the book, thus\\r\\nmaking the ingenious or crafty plea for vaccination that it cannot be\\r\\nexpected to give any more protection than smallpox gives; and therefore\\r\\nreliance must not be placed on one vaccination alone for life, but\\r\\nprotection can only be obtained by re-vaccinations repeated at frequent\\r\\nintervals of a few years!\\r\\n\\r\\nIt will thus be seen that Jenner completely abandoned his false and\\r\\nreckless claim of _perfect protection_ from smallpox _for life_ by\\r\\n_one vaccination_, for which he got his big graft or money prize from\\r\\nthe English government; but, please note, he did not make this retreat\\r\\nor acknowledge his great mistake until after he had pocketed his big\\r\\nreward of thirty thousand pounds for his shamefully false claim of the\\r\\nunlimited protection and perfect safety of vaccination!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSHORT DURATION OF VACCINAL PROTECTION AND NECESSITY OF FREQUENT\\r\\nRE-VACCINATIONS NOW ADMITTED. DANGER FROM SUCH REPEATED VACCINATIONS\\r\\nGREATER THAN FROM SMALLPOX\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have seen in the preceding chapter how the original false and\\r\\nreckless claim of Dr. Jenner for _absolute protection for life from\\r\\none vaccination_ was soon abandoned when put to the actual test of\\r\\nsmallpox epidemics and that a modified position was then taken in the\\r\\nnecessity of re-vaccination in certain periods of about seven years,\\r\\nmore or less. This limited claim has, however, been also abandoned\\r\\nin recent years and the term of alleged vaccinal protection has been\\r\\ngetting successively shorter and shorter, until it has now fallen\\r\\nto the ridiculously short protective period of only six months or a\\r\\nyear for each vaccination or re-vaccination! This seems to be the\\r\\npresent position of our most recent medical authorities and advanced\\r\\nvaccinators, which is not only a great shrinkage in protective claim\\r\\nbut is very interesting and significant in that it closely approaches,\\r\\nand admits, the rational position of the anti-vaccinators who have\\r\\ncontended consistently and persistently from the days of Jenner that\\r\\nvaccination, at the best, gave merely a limited immunity of only a few\\r\\nmonths, more or less, and, in some cases, in very susceptible persons,\\r\\ngave no immunity; and that frequent and repeated vaccinations are more\\r\\ndangerous as being multiple and cumulative infections of an artificial\\r\\nor inflicted disease than beneficial as the preventive of a natural\\r\\ndisease.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo show the present position of advanced pro-vaccinators on this point\\r\\nand their virtual agreement with anti-vaccinators as to the very\\r\\nlimited period of vaccinal protection and the necessity of frequent\\r\\nrepetitions, I will now quote from a recent high medical authority,\\r\\nviz., Dr. Robert Olesen, of the U. S. Public Health Service, stationed\\r\\nat Manila in the Philippine Islands, which is supposed to be one of the\\r\\ngreatest fields in the world for practical experience with smallpox and\\r\\nvaccination.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn an elaborate article by Dr. Olesen printed in the _New York Medical\\r\\nRecord_ of March 4, 1911, he makes these very serious statements as to\\r\\nthe necessity of frequent re-vaccinations and the short duration of\\r\\nprotection from each vaccination, as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n    “THE NECESSITY FOR RE-VACCINATION.--There is abundant reason\\r\\n    for believing that a person who has been successfully\\r\\n    vaccinated is absolutely protected against smallpox during\\r\\n    a period varying from six to twelve months, probably the\\r\\n    latter. After this time his immunity may or may not continue\\r\\n    indefinitely....\\r\\n\\r\\n    “In the absence of means of determining accurately the length\\r\\n    of perfect resistance it is best to re-vaccinate once a year.”\\r\\n\\r\\nNow here we plainly see that this Government Expert after long\\r\\nexperience in the fertile field of the Philippines admits clearly and\\r\\npositively the very limited protective power of vaccination, so that\\r\\nit is practically evanescent in duration, or extends over a few months\\r\\nonly, or at most can not, or should not, be relied on for sure and\\r\\nsafe protection longer than from six months to one year! And for this\\r\\nreason Dr. Olesen carefully advises that “_it is best to re-vaccinate\\r\\nonce a year_.”\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, surely, this modest position of Dr. Olesen as to the short\\r\\nduration of protection and the necessity of re-vaccination _once a\\r\\nyear_ is very similar to the position of the anti-vaccinators, but very\\r\\ndifferent from the positive claim of Dr. Jenner on which vaccination\\r\\nstarted and for which he got his big prize or “graft” of thirty\\r\\nthousand pounds for the grossly false claim of his alleged “discovery”\\r\\nthat _one vaccination_ would give _absolute protection_ from smallpox\\r\\n_for life_!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE DANGEROUS “VACCINATION CREED” OF THE CHICAGO BOARD OF HEALTH\\r\\nEXPLAINED AND CONDEMNED\\r\\n\\r\\nI will now give another great authority on vaccination, viz., the\\r\\nfamous and dangerous “Vaccination Creed” of the Chicago Board of\\r\\nHealth, issued in 1906, and still in use, which limits the protective\\r\\npower of vaccination still more than Dr. Olesen and makes it absolutely\\r\\ndependent on multiple or doubly repeated vaccinations to the point of\\r\\n“saturation,” as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n    “After many years of experience with smallpox and vaccination,\\r\\n    the Chicago Department of Health hereby declares:\\r\\n\\r\\n    “First: That true vaccination--repeated until it no longer\\r\\n    takes--ALWAYS prevents smallpox. NOTHING ELSE DOES.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIt may be now noted that the first and essential article of this\\r\\ncreed, printed with its big emphatic capitals, positively states that\\r\\nthe only vaccination that protects against smallpox is a duplicated,\\r\\nsuccessive, repeated or multiple vaccination--“_repeated until it no\\r\\nlonger takes_.” This means that there must be at least two or three\\r\\nsuccessive vaccinations or multiples of them before any “protection”\\r\\nis obtained, that is, at least one or more successful “takes” and one\\r\\nsubsequent vaccination which fails to take! In other words, we must\\r\\nvaccinate repeatedly until it takes, and then vaccinate repeatedly\\r\\nuntil it fails to take, to get any protection; and this, in some cases,\\r\\nmay of course require from two to four or six successive vaccinations!\\r\\nAnd yet this is the only kind of _redoubled_ vaccination which this\\r\\nfamous, or infamous, creed gravely and emphatically tells us in full\\r\\nand loud capitals “ALWAYS” prevents smallpox and that “NOTHING ELSE\\r\\nDOES”! And while Dr. Olesen tells us that one successful vaccination,\\r\\nrepeated at least once every year, is a fairly reliable protection\\r\\nagainst smallpox, yet this “Chicago Creed” positively tells us that\\r\\nsuch “successful” yearly vaccination is no good at all unless followed\\r\\nat once by another vaccination _which is not successful_! What do you\\r\\nnow think, Mr. President, of the absurdity and confusion in these\\r\\nvaccination theories? And what do you think of the great personal\\r\\nrepulsiveness and great medical danger of these theories in calling for\\r\\nso many and such frequent inoculations of disease virus or blood poison\\r\\nto give alleged protection from the so-called dangerous disease of\\r\\nsmallpox which ordinarily kills less people every year than lightning\\r\\nand which in an epidemic year kills less than ordinary measles or\\r\\nwhooping-cough kills every year?\\r\\n\\r\\nNow while such wholesale and repeated or redoubled or saturated\\r\\nvaccinations for every person, every year, would undoubtedly be a most\\r\\nprofitable thing for vaccinating doctors and vaccine makers and would\\r\\nextend the use of vaccine virus _ten to one hundred fold_, yet it is\\r\\nvery doubtful whether this would be any benefit to public health.\\r\\nOn the contrary, this would be the most grave menace to private and\\r\\npublic health that could be conceived; for, whereas, the limited\\r\\nvaccination now practiced actually causes more deaths per year than\\r\\nsmallpox, particularly in little school children, what would happen to\\r\\nour precious children and our brave soldiers and sailors if we were\\r\\nto adopt the horribly dangerous theories of multiple or redoubled or\\r\\n“saturated” vaccination every year for each person, according to the\\r\\n“Creeds” of Dr. Olesen and the Chicago Board of Health, which these\\r\\nexperts assure us is the only way to get any certain protection from\\r\\nsmallpox?\\r\\n\\r\\nNow if only one vaccination were required for life protection, it\\r\\nwould, obviously, not involve as much risk from vaccinal infections\\r\\nor “complications,” such as Lockjaw, Septicemia, Meningitis and\\r\\nPneumonia; but if the vaccinations have to be repeated every few\\r\\nmonths or a year as Dr. Olesen directs, or, furthermore, if they have\\r\\nto be redoubled and repeated “_until it no longer takes_,” as in the\\r\\n“Chicago Creed,” then the infecting risk is obviously very different\\r\\nand is so much increased with each repeated inoculation that the danger\\r\\nof these repeated and cumulative infections from the artificial or\\r\\ninflicted septicemic disease called “cowpox” becomes much worse than\\r\\nthe danger from the natural disease, smallpox, so that the patient is\\r\\nthus more likely to suffer and die from the “cure” rather than from\\r\\nthe “disease,” as now frequently happens from vaccinations, as I have\\r\\nalready abundantly proved by shocking examples in these pages.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE FALSE GLORY OF JENNER AND THE DISGRACE OF THE MEDICAL PROFESSION\\r\\n\\r\\nIf, therefore, it were ever really true that one vaccination gave sure\\r\\nprotection from smallpox for life and that the act of vaccination was\\r\\nin itself perfectly safe and harmless, as Jenner positively claimed,\\r\\nvaccination might then of course be a grand thing, of immense benefit\\r\\nto the human race, and might perhaps deserve all the good things\\r\\nthat have been said about it by its interested flatterers and false\\r\\nadvocates! But, of course, these big claims of life protection and\\r\\nperfect safety never were true but have been the gigantic falsehoods\\r\\non which the great evil of compulsory vaccination has been justified\\r\\nby the medical profession and forced by it upon the people for many\\r\\nyears past with great damage to human health and life--how much\\r\\nwill never be known--and with great ethical disgrace to the medical\\r\\nprofession itself, as I have already proved, and from which disgrace\\r\\nthe profession should, surely, free itself at an early day for the sake\\r\\nof professional honor and decency if not for the sake of human right\\r\\nand safety, health and life.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWHAT PROTECTS US FROM SMALLPOX IN MODERN TIMES? IS IT VACCINATION OR\\r\\nSOMETHING ELSE? A FALSE CLAIM EXPLODED\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have just seen in the preceding chapter that high medical\\r\\nauthorities positively assure us that vaccination gives no protection\\r\\nagainst smallpox unless it is done freshly once a year and is also then\\r\\ndone _repeatedly_, “_until it no longer takes_,” which will surely\\r\\nrequire at least two successive vaccinations and may require from two\\r\\nto three, four or more successive vaccinations each year! Now let us\\r\\nseriously ask here: How many persons are there in the civil population\\r\\nor in the Army and Navy who have ever been, or are now, vaccinated in\\r\\nthis way, viz., regularly once a year and then vaccinated repeatedly\\r\\nuntil the condition of _vaccinal saturation_ is reached where “_it no\\r\\nlonger takes_”? I firmly believe that no well informed doctor, student\\r\\nor statistician will deny that _not five per cent._ of the civil\\r\\npopulation or of the Army and Navy has ever been vaccinated according\\r\\nto this rule and system which the experts assure us is the only safe\\r\\nand certain rule for vaccinal protection from smallpox! What, then,\\r\\nkeeps the general population and the men of the Army and Navy so free\\r\\nfrom smallpox that for the generation past there are ordinarily less\\r\\nannual deaths from smallpox than from lightning? Surely it can not\\r\\nbe vaccination that is responsible for this freedom from smallpox in\\r\\nmodern times when not five per cent. of the population is vaccinated so\\r\\nthat it can have any protection from smallpox!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe extreme pro-vaccinator has, however, long and loudly claimed, and\\r\\nhas deceived himself and the trusting public with this false claim,\\r\\nthat general vaccination is practically the sole and only thing that\\r\\nhas brought about the modern reduction of smallpox or that can ever\\r\\nreduce smallpox! But this claim is obviously absurd and false on\\r\\nits face when we have already seen that not five per cent. of the\\r\\npopulation is vaccinated in such a way as can give any protection,\\r\\nand that ninety-five per cent. of the vaccinated population has no\\r\\neffective vaccinal protection whatever!\\r\\n\\r\\nThis false claim that vaccination has been the chief cause of the\\r\\nreduction in smallpox in modern times is further positively disproved\\r\\nby the flagrant fact that countries which are most extensively\\r\\nvaccinated have had the worst epidemics in modern times, such as the\\r\\ncase of Japan cited on page 53; and that as a rule in all smallpox\\r\\nepidemics the great majority of cases always occur in well vaccinated\\r\\nsubjects and the minority in unvaccinated subjects as officially\\r\\nacknowledged in the last epidemic in New York City in 1901 and 1902,\\r\\ncited on page 204.\\r\\n\\r\\nSurely, therefore, vaccination cannot be solely responsible for the\\r\\ngreat modern reduction of smallpox, but, per contra, there have been\\r\\nsome great benign, natural and artificial conditions which have\\r\\nintervened in human life since the old days of big smallpox epidemics\\r\\nand the adoption of vaccination, which benign conditions have brought\\r\\nabout the great decline in smallpox--and not the unnatural and\\r\\nirrational condition of vaccination which has been falsely credited\\r\\nwith this result. And it must be obvious that benign conditions which\\r\\nact by the _prevention_ and _reduction_ of disease are more likely to\\r\\nproduce this result than a remedy like vaccination, which means the\\r\\nactual propagation and infliction of disease. Now what are these benign\\r\\nconditions? They are clearly of two kinds, “Natural” and “Artificial.”\\r\\nThey are, first, natural, that is, some pervasive natural changes in\\r\\nconditions of human life, which are more or less unknown or not yet\\r\\nfully understood in their exact nature, but which have surely brought\\r\\nabout a great reduction in the general death-rate and also in specific\\r\\ndeath-rates from several deadly diseases, in which no remedy such as\\r\\nvaccination has ever been used, and yet the general death-rate and\\r\\nthe death-rates of these particular diseases have been reduced in\\r\\nmodern times even more than smallpox has been reduced since the use\\r\\nof vaccination. For a few examples of these greatly reduced diseases\\r\\nwe might mention Bubonic Plague, Epidemic Erysipelas, Typhus Fevers,\\r\\nCholera, Scurvy, etc., etc. All of these terrible diseases which were\\r\\nonce as bad or worse than smallpox have been not only reduced more\\r\\nthan smallpox in modern times, but most of them have practically been\\r\\ntotally obliterated in modern life, so that they have now become\\r\\nalmost medical curiosities, and yet no such thing as vaccination has\\r\\nbeen used in this reduction. The other conditions which have brought\\r\\nabout this reduction of these deadly diseases are the artificial and\\r\\npurely benign conditions of Sanitation, Hygiene and Isolation. Now\\r\\nif these safe and benign natural and artificial conditions have,\\r\\nundeniably, brought about the reduction or obliteration of these\\r\\nterrible diseases without any vaccination, is it not most logical and\\r\\nreasonable to conclude that these same safe and benign conditions have\\r\\nbeen the chief cause in reducing smallpox also, and that the burden\\r\\nof proof is clearly on the pro-vaccinators to prove, if they can, the\\r\\npreposterous claim that vaccination is the chief cause of this great\\r\\nreduction of smallpox?\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this point this striking historic and medical fact should be\\r\\ndistinctly remembered that before the adoption of vaccination, and\\r\\nfor some time afterwards, there were practically no such remedies\\r\\nknown or used as Sanitation, Hygiene or Isolation. These rational\\r\\ndefenses against smallpox and other diseases are in fact of very recent\\r\\nusage and have practically been used, in any extended or efficient\\r\\nmanner, only within the last generation! And the reduction in smallpox\\r\\npractically dates from this usage and is proportional to the extent\\r\\nand regularity of this usage. See the great success of sanitation and\\r\\nisolation, etc., in reducing smallpox, without vaccination, in the\\r\\nEnglish City of Leicester and the general effect of sanitation in\\r\\nrecent times as set forth in the book, “The Vaccination Question,” by\\r\\nDr. Millard, London, 1914.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt may therefore be very hard for us to realize this fact in modern\\r\\ntimes, that in the old unsanitary days of big epidemics and deadly\\r\\nplagues, the general population had no clear idea at all of the actual\\r\\ncontagiousness of epidemic diseases or that they were spread by actual\\r\\n_contact_ or close proximity, from one person to the other, and\\r\\ntherefore no effort whatever was made to isolate cases of dangerous\\r\\ndisease like smallpox, which were thus commonly left freely exposed\\r\\nin public and private until they spread like wildfire through the\\r\\nwhole community in frequent and wide-spread epidemics common in those\\r\\ndays. Per contra, the idea generally held by the people in these old,\\r\\nunsanitary times was that epidemic diseases were spread universally,\\r\\nby some general malign influence, through the air--not by contact\\r\\nfrom person to person--and that they were _divine scourges_ sent by\\r\\nthe wrath of God to punish man for his sins, and that it was not only\\r\\nuseless but even impious to try to escape these scourges. Hence the old\\r\\nbarbarous schemes of smallpox inoculation and cowpox vaccination agreed\\r\\nperfectly with this barbarous medical theology, for by these remedies\\r\\nthe sinner or penitent patient did not try to escape the wrath of God\\r\\nbut willingly bowed to it and took the scourge upon himself in a mild\\r\\nform with the hope in Divine Mercy to escape it in its worst form! This\\r\\nseems to have been the medical psychology of vaccination in past times!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE UNSANITARY CONDITIONS OF JENNER’S DAY EXPOSED. POWER OF SANITATION\\r\\nTO EXTINGUISH SMALLPOX ADMITTED BY JENNER’S CHIEF ASSISTANT IN 1815\\r\\n\\r\\nIt can therefore be readily seen that, as soon as the barbarous\\r\\nsystem of deliberately inviting and spreading disease described in\\r\\nthe preceding paragraph was abandoned, and the reckless exposure of\\r\\nsmallpox in public and private was prevented by strict isolation\\r\\nand proper sanitation, smallpox epidemics were bound to decline and\\r\\ndisappear. But this result has happened only in very recent times\\r\\nin advanced communities which have adopted some effective system\\r\\nof sanitation and isolation, and with little effect one way or the\\r\\nother from vaccination except that smallpox and other diseases and\\r\\nthe general death-rate seem to be much worse where vaccination is\\r\\nextensively used and sanitation, isolation and hygiene are neglected,\\r\\nas has been proved flagrantly in the case of much-vaccinated Japan,\\r\\ncited on page 53, and, reversely, in the case of the English City\\r\\nof Leicester, cited on page 22, where the best effects in reduction\\r\\nof smallpox and increase in general health have been produced by\\r\\nabandoning vaccination and relying on sanitation, isolation and hygiene\\r\\nfor the last thirty-five years.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, a very interesting and convincing evidence in this direction is\\r\\nfurnished by Dr. Jenner’s chief assistant, Dr. James Moore, before\\r\\nquoted, who, writing over one hundred years ago, clearly recognized\\r\\nand admitted the truth and force of the above contention, viz., that\\r\\nsanitation and isolation would extinguish epidemic smallpox, without\\r\\nregard to vaccination; and this point I will now prove from Dr. Moore’s\\r\\nbook on “The History of Smallpox,” published in London in 1815, which\\r\\nseems to have been one of the first authorities to urge sanitation and\\r\\nisolation for the suppression of this disease.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn pages 304 to 307 in Dr. Moore’s book, he gives a very clear\\r\\nstatement of the above point, as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n    “The plague was a less destructive distemper than the Small\\r\\n    Pox, yet no plan similar to the quarantine laws has been\\r\\n    established to extinguish this infection; and one which was\\r\\n    lately proposed in Parliament was discouraged as injurious to\\r\\n    personal freedom.”\\r\\n\\r\\n    “But surely every man susceptible of a dangerous contagion\\r\\n    has a natural right to hinder persons who are contaminated\\r\\n    with that disease, from touching or even approaching him. The\\r\\n    exercise of this right is a species of self defence; which for\\r\\n    the public safety may assuredly be regulated by law, without\\r\\n    infringing any reasonable notions of political liberty.”\\r\\n\\r\\n    “It is therefore much to be wished, that to preclude all\\r\\n    persons infected with the Small Pox from mixing with the\\r\\n    public, a law should be enacted to confine them strictly to\\r\\n    their own houses, or in hospitals appropriated by the parishes\\r\\n    for that purpose, as long as the infection is upon them.”\\r\\n\\r\\n    “The plan is simple, to enforce it would be easy; and the sole\\r\\n    inconvenience would be a temporary confinement of those persons\\r\\n    whose enlargement spreads poison through the land.”\\r\\n\\r\\n    “By such a measure, the infection of the Small Pox, for want\\r\\n    of subjects to act upon, would necessarily decline, and soon\\r\\n    become extinct; and multitudes of human creatures would be\\r\\n    annually preserved from disease, blindness and death.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIt will now be seen that this interesting medical and historical\\r\\nauthority shows us that, while quarantine or isolation had been used to\\r\\nsome extent in old times in the prevention of the plague, yet it had\\r\\nnever been applied to smallpox, and that a law proposed in the English\\r\\nParliament in 1815 to make isolation compulsory was defeated; but Dr.\\r\\nMoore distinctly tells us that such a law or practice, if enforced,\\r\\nwould by itself extinguish smallpox!\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, this admission I regard as very significant and conclusive in this\\r\\ncontention in coming from Dr. Moore, who was a medical authority in\\r\\nJenner’s day, being a member of the Royal College of Surgeons of London\\r\\nand Surgeon of the Second Regiment of Life Guards, and was also so\\r\\nclose to Jenner that he dedicated his book to him, and was not only his\\r\\nchief assistant in the new scheme of vaccination but held the important\\r\\noffice of “Director of the National Vaccine Establishment,” which was\\r\\nthe government institution controlling the production of vaccine virus\\r\\nand the administration of public vaccination.\\r\\n\\r\\nSurely, therefore, we could have no better authority than Dr. Moore\\r\\nto admit and establish our present contention against the modern evil\\r\\nof compulsory vaccination, viz., that there is surely something else\\r\\nbesides vaccination that has prevented or reduced smallpox epidemics in\\r\\nmodern times, and that something is the benign and rational remedies\\r\\nof sanitation and isolation with certain natural and human changes\\r\\nand improvements in conditions of human life and health; and not the\\r\\nirrational and malign remedy of propagating and inflicting general\\r\\ndisease upon the people, as falsely taught by the extreme vaccinators.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFURTHER PROOF FROM THE ENGLISH MINISTER OF HEALTH THAT SANITATION\\r\\nPREVENTS SMALLPOX MORE THAN VACCINATION. POORLY VACCINATED LONDON MORE\\r\\nHEALTHY THAN MUCH-VACCINATED BERLIN\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a speech by the Hon. John Burns, Minister of Health for England and\\r\\nWales, in the House of Commons on April 11, 1912, he gave the following\\r\\nclear statement showing that vaccination cannot be alone credited with\\r\\nthe reduction of smallpox, but that, as a matter of fact, smallpox had\\r\\ndeclined as vaccination was reduced and as sanitation and other benign\\r\\nconditions of human life had increased. These most significant facts\\r\\nare fully expressed in the following extract from the official speech,\\r\\nwhich speaks clearly for itself and needs no further comment here.\\r\\n\\r\\n    “I am not at all alarmed by the comparison made with\\r\\n    Germany.... I entertain the respect for figures tempered by\\r\\n    fact, which every responsible man ought to have. Just in\\r\\n    proportion as in recent years exemptions (from vaccination)\\r\\n    have gone up from four per cent. to thirty per cent., so\\r\\n    deaths from smallpox have declined.... The facts are these:\\r\\n    I am right in giving these figures with regard to London.\\r\\n    During the time that I have had the honor of being at the\\r\\n    Local Government Board the following have been the deaths from\\r\\n    smallpox in a city of 4,500,000 inhabitants: 1906, no deaths;\\r\\n    1907, no deaths; 1908, no deaths; 1909, two deaths; 1910, no\\r\\n    deaths. So that in five years there have only been two deaths\\r\\n    from smallpox in a city of 4,500,000 people. Not even Germany\\r\\n    or Berlin can transcend those figures by the increasing\\r\\n    cleanliness, increasing sobriety and greater attention paid\\r\\n    both by the community and individuals to removing all causes of\\r\\n    smallpox, and nearly every other disease.... I believe that all\\r\\n    this fear and panic, all this talk about plague and smallpox,\\r\\n    is due to misconception and misapprehension of social facts.\\r\\n    These diseases are in a very different position from what\\r\\n    they were in ten, twenty, thirty or forty years ago, and it\\r\\n    is a creditable and a happy circumstance that I, as Minister\\r\\n    of Health for England and Wales, am enabled to state that in\\r\\n    regard to the administration of public health no other country\\r\\n    is comparable to ours, and I am pleased to have heard such\\r\\n    hearty recognition of our efforts from the different speakers\\r\\n    this afternoon.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI therefore think that this close study of vaccination facts thus far\\r\\npresented must convince every reasonable mind, lay or medical, that\\r\\nif these benign conditions of sanitation, isolation, etc., had been\\r\\ngenerally adopted and enforced for the past century, in place of the\\r\\ndangerous remedy of general or compulsory vaccination, smallpox would\\r\\nhave become extinct before this time and as much of a medical curiosity\\r\\nas Plague, Cholera, Typhus and Scurvy now are, which at one time\\r\\nslaughtered their thousands every year!\\r\\n\\r\\nI also believe that it is probably due to this evil practice of general\\r\\nvaccination, which is simply the propagation and infliction on the\\r\\ngeneral population of actual smallpox in one of its various forms, that\\r\\nthe pestilence of smallpox has been kept alive as a still dangerous\\r\\nmenace to human health and life, ready to burst out into conflagration\\r\\nwherever vaccination is recklessly and extensively used, as in the\\r\\nrecent case of Japan, or where sanitation is grossly neglected, instead\\r\\nof being now a medical curiosity, like the other great plagues of the\\r\\npast which we have successfully extinguished without any vaccination.\\r\\nAnd as smallpox is the only one of the ancient plagues that we have\\r\\ndeliberately cultivated, propagated and constantly inflicted upon\\r\\nthe human population, under a barbarous and false theory of thereby\\r\\npreventing disease, is it any wonder, in common sense and common logic,\\r\\nthat we have so signally succeeded in keeping this ancient plague alive\\r\\nby this strange medical malpractice, while the other ancient plagues\\r\\nhave become extinguished?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nONLY A LIMITED AND VOLUNTARY USE OF VACCINATION SUGGESTED AND APPROVED.\\r\\nFORCED VACCINATION OF SCHOOL CHILDREN CONDEMNED\\r\\n\\r\\nI firmly believe that vaccination should be used only, or chiefly,\\r\\nin smallpox hospitals, or elsewhere, by doctors and nurses whose\\r\\nprofessional duties require them to be exposed directly to smallpox\\r\\ninfection and who necessarily have to take the professional chances\\r\\nof injury or infection from either the smallpox or the vaccination.\\r\\nIf, therefore, vaccination confers any protection or immunity from\\r\\nsmallpox, even for a short or limited time, it is, of course, proper\\r\\nfor doctors, nurses and attendants to make use of this protection as\\r\\nfar and as frequent as they may wish or consider necessary. It is, of\\r\\ncourse, also proper for any person, whether exposed or not exposed to\\r\\nsmallpox, to voluntarily resort to vaccination whenever he may see fit\\r\\nto do so, or as his doctor may advise, as this is the unalienable right\\r\\nof Medical Freedom for which we contend and to which all citizens are\\r\\nentitled. But to force the whole population, and particularly little\\r\\nchildren, to submit to the dangerous operation of vaccination, when\\r\\nthe merest fraction of this population, or not one in a thousand,\\r\\nwould ever be exposed to any probable chance of actual contact with\\r\\nsmallpox, and therefore not requiring any protection against it, would,\\r\\nobviously, be a very absurd, unwise and dangerous practice; because to\\r\\nthus vaccinate the mass of this healthy, unexposed and unendangered\\r\\npopulation would simply be widely extending disease and infection where\\r\\nit did not already exist, and would be inflicting a form of artificial\\r\\nsmallpox on the whole population which, as I have already clearly\\r\\nproved, might be more dangerous in the long run than the ordinary\\r\\nchances from natural smallpox itself. This is particularly true when I\\r\\nhave shown from high medical authorities that vaccination gives only\\r\\nan evanescent protection, or immunity for short periods of time, from\\r\\na few months to a year, and requires to be continued at such short\\r\\nintervals and doubled or repeated at each interval, which frequent\\r\\nrepetitions greatly increase the chances of incurring more injury from\\r\\nthe many vaccinations than from smallpox!\\r\\n\\r\\nWhere, however, vaccination is used by the doctors, nurses or\\r\\nattendants at the smallpox hospitals, or by any other person actually\\r\\nexposed or likely to be exposed to the disease, the case is entirely\\r\\ndifferent and the burden of the chances and dangers is safely shifted\\r\\nand greatly reduced, as, in this case, the artificial disease of\\r\\nvaccination is inflicted to protect the vaccinated person from the\\r\\nnatural disease of smallpox only where this disease already exists and\\r\\nactually endangers the person exposed to it. This is entirely different\\r\\nfrom the practice of inflicting and spreading disease widely where\\r\\nit does not already exist, as in the evil system of the wholesale\\r\\nvaccination of school children and the general population who are not\\r\\nexposed to smallpox and may never be exposed to it in a lifetime.\\r\\nThe absurdity and uselessness of vaccinating school children where\\r\\nno smallpox exists, and where there is no chance of being exposed to\\r\\nit, is proved by the short period of protection given by vaccination\\r\\nand now admitted by vaccinators; because the limited protection given\\r\\nby vaccination at such a time, when not needed, would probably have\\r\\nexpired by the time it was needed by the appearance of any epidemic\\r\\nor sporadic case, thus making the previous vaccination needless and\\r\\nanother vaccination necessary. As a fresh vaccination, therefore, is\\r\\nthe only thing that gives any sure protection, and this for a few\\r\\nmonths only, there is surely no use in vaccinating any children, on\\r\\nthe vaccinators’ own showing, until they are actually menaced by the\\r\\npresence of smallpox infection or epidemic.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nABSURDITY OF COMPULSORY VACCINATION OF CHILDREN OF SCHOOL AGE WHO HAVE\\r\\nHIGHEST IMMUNITY AND VITALITY AND LOWEST DEATH-RATE OF ANY PART OF THE\\r\\nPOPULATION\\r\\n\\r\\nTo single out children of school age for this application of wholesale\\r\\nand compulsory vaccination, as is done under the present evil school\\r\\nvaccination law which has been originated and sustained by our medical\\r\\nsocieties, is particularly absurd, mischievous and unethical from a\\r\\ntrue medical, sanitary and hygienic standpoint; because it is a most\\r\\nextraordinary fact, which seems to be little known by the doctors or\\r\\nthe laity, that children of school age have the greatest immunity\\r\\nfrom all disease and the lowest general death-rate of any part of the\\r\\npopulation, and to a most surprising degree, and are therefore in less\\r\\nneed of the alleged protection of vaccination than any other part of\\r\\nthe population! Whereas it is generally falsely assumed that they are\\r\\nin most need of such protection. This relative immunity and vitality\\r\\nis, however, so great that children of school age from 6 to 19 have\\r\\nonly five per cent. of the total deaths from all causes, although they\\r\\nconstitute about twenty-five per cent. of the whole population! The\\r\\nchildren of school age have therefore about twelve times the immunity\\r\\nand vitality of the infant age under six years and about six times\\r\\nthe vitality and immunity of all the rest of the population over\\r\\nnineteen! See Report of the New York State Department of Health for\\r\\n1912, page 125. See also my pamphlet, “The Crime Against the School\\r\\nChild,” 1915, pages 32-33. This extraordinary fact alone condemns\\r\\nall compulsory vaccination of school children as a most medically\\r\\nincongruous, barbarous and unnecessary practice. But this evil creation\\r\\nof our medical societies will never be given up by our infallibilistic\\r\\nvaccinators until the common sense of the laity is firmly asserted to\\r\\nmake all vaccination in schools or elsewhere free and voluntary and\\r\\nto demand the repeal of the evil compulsory vaccination law wherever\\r\\nit exists, which has probably killed three times more children than\\r\\nsmallpox in the last ten or fifteen years.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nVACCINATION A POOR PROTECTION AGAINST DISEASE. FLAGRANT AND FREQUENT\\r\\nFAILURE TO PROTECT FROM SMALLPOX OR TYPHOID FEVER SHOWN BY MANY TYPICAL\\r\\nINSTANCES AT HOME AND ABROAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the outset I stated that I did not need to discuss the merits or\\r\\ndemerits of vaccination in its alleged preventive or immunizing power\\r\\nagainst disease; and while these merits had been much exaggerated,\\r\\nyet, whatever they were, small or large, did not matter much, as the\\r\\nchief question was the danger of vaccination to health and life. This\\r\\nwas also the chief question with the evil predecessors of modern\\r\\nvaccination, viz., the old smallpox inoculation and Jenner’s arm-to-arm\\r\\nvaccination, both of which were admitted to have some protective power\\r\\nagainst smallpox, yet both were finally condemned and prohibited\\r\\nby public opinion and penal law because they were found to be very\\r\\ndangerous to human health and life and actually caused more disease and\\r\\ndeath in the long run than they prevented.\\r\\n\\r\\nI think I have already proved in the preceding pages, without any\\r\\ndoubt, the serious dangers of modern bovine vaccination to human health\\r\\nand life, and that it now, in fact, often causes more deaths than\\r\\nsmallpox, particularly in infants and school children, and has also\\r\\nbeen the cause of many dangerous epidemics among animals and mankind;\\r\\nand that for these capital reasons all compulsory vaccination should\\r\\nbe absolutely abolished and prohibited, and voluntary vaccination only\\r\\nallowed.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn order, therefore, to show the meager or limited protective power\\r\\nof vaccination and its common, proved and admitted failure to protect\\r\\nfrom epidemic disease, I will now give several typical examples of this\\r\\nfailure, both with the more common smallpox vaccination and the more\\r\\nrecent typhoid vaccination, so as to complete this indictment against\\r\\nthe medical malpractice of compulsory vaccination in all forms and\\r\\nleave nothing further which need be said on this subject in these pages\\r\\nto bring conviction to every reasonable mind that the barbarous medical\\r\\nscheme of compulsory disease is a very dangerous and fallacious mode of\\r\\nimproving public health.\\r\\n\\r\\nEXAMPLE FIRST. From Report of Registrar General of England for last\\r\\ngreat epidemic year of 1902:\\r\\n\\r\\n  Population of England and Wales 33,000,000\\r\\n  Total Deaths from Smallpox            2464\\r\\n  Vaccinated Cases                821\\r\\n  Unvaccinated Cases              791\\r\\n  Condition Not Stated            852\\r\\n                                  ---\\r\\n                                 2464\\r\\n\\r\\nSurely there is no proof here that vaccination is much of a protection\\r\\nfrom smallpox, but rather the very reverse, because it is here shown\\r\\nthat the majority of fatal cases are vaccinated.\\r\\n\\r\\nEXAMPLE SECOND. During the last great smallpox epidemic in New York\\r\\nCity in 1901 and 1902, the City Department of Health issued a printed\\r\\ncircular to doctors, dated in 1902, which clearly acknowledged that\\r\\nthe majority of all cases in this epidemic occurred in persons who\\r\\nhad been successfully vaccinated a few years previously, and not\\r\\nin unvaccinated persons! This statement was signed by Dr. Ernst J.\\r\\nLederle, Commissioner of Health, and Dr. Hermann M. Biggs, Chief\\r\\nMedical Officer, and was in part as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n    “Experience in the recent outbreaks in New York City, contrary\\r\\n    to the general opinion, has shown that the majority of the\\r\\n    cases occurring here are not in unvaccinated persons, but\\r\\n    in those who have been vaccinated successfully some years\\r\\n    previously.”\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Lederle, who signed this statement, is now a manufacturer of\\r\\nvaccines and serums in New York City, and Dr. Biggs is now the Health\\r\\nCommissioner of the State of New York at Albany.\\r\\n\\r\\nEXAMPLE THIRD. Health Officer Raymond of Brooklyn stated in the\\r\\n_Brooklyn Eagle_ of June 5, 1902, that in the epidemic in Brooklyn in\\r\\n1902, in the first half of that year, there were 357 cases of smallpox\\r\\nand that 322 of these cases were all vaccinated and only 35 cases\\r\\nunvaccinated!\\r\\n\\r\\nSurely these last two examples, right at our own doors, show that\\r\\nvaccination is little or no protection, or, to say the least, is a\\r\\nvery poor protection, from smallpox, or has such a limited duration\\r\\nor period of protection that it fades out very rapidly and needs to\\r\\nbe renewed and repeated frequently, with great possible danger to\\r\\nhealth and life, as already proved, and admitted by medical authorities\\r\\npreviously quoted, so that this “cure” not only often fails but may\\r\\nbecome finally worse than the “disease.”\\r\\n\\r\\nEXAMPLE FOURTH. Smallpox in Germany, the best vaccinated country in\\r\\nEurope, as given in U. S. Public Health Report for January 23, 1914:\\r\\n\\r\\n_Record of Smallpox Cases and Vaccinal Conditions for Three Years,\\r\\n1908, 1909, 1910_\\r\\n\\r\\n  Total cases                              917\\r\\n  Vaccinated and re-vaccinated         671\\r\\n  Unvaccinated                         143\\r\\n  Unknown                               28\\r\\n  Vaccinated unsuccessfully or too late 75\\r\\n                                       ---\\r\\n                                       917\\r\\n\\r\\nHere we plainly see that in this much-vaccinated country--the pride\\r\\nof vaccinators--the cases of smallpox among the well vaccinated and\\r\\nre-vaccinated were _over four times_ the number of cases among the\\r\\nunvaccinated! Surely this example, with the two previous ones, clearly\\r\\nproves that vaccination is not very much of a protection! And surely\\r\\nthere is nothing in these examples which any vaccinator can get much\\r\\ncomfort from or use as a moral or medical justification of the shameful\\r\\nand evil practice of forcing compulsory vaccination upon the whole\\r\\ncommunity under the shocking falsehood that it is the infallible and\\r\\nonly protection against smallpox! And surely these forceful and\\r\\nhumiliating facts give a stinging rebuke to this false contention.\\r\\n\\r\\nEXAMPLE FIFTH. The fully vaccinated U. S. battle-ship _Ohio_ versus the\\r\\nunvaccinated City of Niagara Falls, N. Y.\\r\\n\\r\\nA smallpox epidemic raged on this battle-ship at Guantanamo, Cuba, in\\r\\nDecember, 1913, and January, 1914, with these figures:\\r\\n\\r\\n  Population about      1000\\r\\n  Smallpox Cases          29\\r\\n  Deaths                   5\\r\\n\\r\\nPer contra, an epidemic existed in Niagara Falls from 1912 to 1914,\\r\\ninclusive, as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n  Population                            40,000\\r\\n  Total cases of Smallpox          550\\r\\n  Deaths from Smallpox                       1\\r\\n  Deaths from Vaccination                    3\\r\\n  Never vaccinated                 483\\r\\n  Vaccinated over five years        26\\r\\n  Vaccinated for less than 5 years   5\\r\\n  Not stated                        36\\r\\n                                   ---\\r\\n                                   550\\r\\n\\r\\nLogical comparison of the vaccinated ship with the unvaccinated city,\\r\\nas follows:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe vaccinated ship had twenty-nine cases and five deaths per thousand\\r\\npopulation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis same ratio of disease and death applied to the 40,000 population\\r\\nof Niagara Falls would call for 1160 cases and 200 deaths! Whereas\\r\\nthe cases were actually only fourteen per thousand population and the\\r\\ndeaths one fortieth of one person per thousand population, while the\\r\\nknown deaths from vaccination were three!\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is surely not difficult to decide here as to which makes the worst\\r\\nshowing, the vaccinated ship or the unvaccinated city! And while\\r\\nvaccinators are very fond of referring to this case of Niagara Falls\\r\\nas a great example of the virtue and need of vaccination, we think it\\r\\nmust be obvious that the less they say of this case as compared with\\r\\nthe vaccinated battle-ship _Ohio_, the better it will be for the cause\\r\\nof vaccination and the logic of the vaccinator. Here we see five deaths\\r\\nfrom smallpox in the well vaccinated battle-ship with 1000 population,\\r\\nand one death from smallpox in the unvaccinated city of 40,000\\r\\npopulation, which is a ratio of mortality, on basis of population, _two\\r\\nhundred times greater_ in the well vaccinated battle-ship than in the\\r\\nunvaccinated city!\\r\\n\\r\\nBesides this difference of smallpox cases and deaths in favor of the\\r\\nunvaccinated city, there were three deaths from vaccination in the\\r\\nNiagara Falls population or three times more than the deaths from\\r\\nsmallpox!\\r\\n\\r\\nFor some of these facts as to Niagara Falls see the Report of the New\\r\\nYork State Department of Health for 1914, page 102. The three alleged\\r\\ndeaths from vaccination are denied, as usual, by the health officials,\\r\\nbut we have convincing evidence to prove them as most probably due to\\r\\nvaccination. These three fatal cases were: Miss Hull, school teacher,\\r\\nvaccinated when she was suffering from kidney disease; Bernard Moran,\\r\\na very old man, vaccinated when he was suffering from heart disease;\\r\\nand John George Chambers, a strong man, killed by a clear case of acute\\r\\nblood poisoning or septicemia with complications immediately following\\r\\nthe vaccination and extending from the vaccination sore.\\r\\n\\r\\nEXAMPLE SIXTH. The flagrant failure of Typhoid Vaccination in the U. S.\\r\\nArmy in England and France.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following extracts are taken from the Report of the Chief Surgeon\\r\\nof the A. E. F., printed in U. S. Public Health Reports for March\\r\\n28, 1919, entitled: “Typhoid Vaccination No Substitute for Sanitary\\r\\nPrecautions.” These extracts tell their story, most plainly and\\r\\npositively, as to the abject failure of typhoid vaccination to protect\\r\\nfrom disease where and when this protection is really needed, that is,\\r\\nwhere serious actual infection exists due to unsanitary conditions;\\r\\nand they also prove the necessity and superior value of sanitation as\\r\\na protection from disease. I now quote these extracts verbatim as they\\r\\nappear in the official Report. They speak clearly for themselves and\\r\\nneed no comment here to emphasize their great force and significance as\\r\\na strong argument against compulsory vaccination from the vaccinators\\r\\nthemselves.\\r\\n\\r\\n    “In July, 1918, a replacement unit consisting of 248 men from\\r\\n    Camp Cody, N. Mex., reached England with typhoid prevailing\\r\\n    extensively; 98 men, or 39.5 per cent., had typhoid, and the\\r\\n    case death-rate was 8.42 per cent.\\r\\n\\r\\n    “It was evident from the investigation that the men were\\r\\n    exposed to infection through contaminated drinking water while\\r\\n    en route to the port of embarkation in the United States. The\\r\\n    unit had been vaccinated a few months prior to the occurrence\\r\\n    of the epidemic. Most of the patients presented the typical\\r\\n    clinical features of typhoid.”\\r\\n\\r\\n    “In August, 1916, a small but severe epidemic occurred in a\\r\\n    detachment of Engineer troops stationed at Bazoilles. In this\\r\\n    unit fifteen cases of typhoid occurred, with a death-rate\\r\\n    approximating ten per cent.”\\r\\n\\r\\n    “Following the offensive in the Argonne sector, typhoid and\\r\\n    paratyphoid began to be reported from practically all divisions\\r\\n    engaged in that offensive. It is quite evident that the initial\\r\\n    cases were due in large part to drinking infected water.”\\r\\n\\r\\n    “More than 300 cases of typhoid-paratyphoid may be attributed\\r\\n    to the Argonne offensive. Eight hundred and seventy-four\\r\\n    typhoids and paratyphoids have been reported in the American\\r\\n    Expeditionary Forces since October 1, 1918.”\\r\\n\\r\\n    “A small but severe epidemic occurred in the Joinville\\r\\n    concentration area in December and January. In a group of\\r\\n    Medical Department units (evacuation and mobile hospitals\\r\\n    and sanitary trains) concentrated there seventy-five cases\\r\\n    occurred, with a case death-rate of approximately twenty per\\r\\n    cent.”\\r\\n\\r\\n    “The records of this office show that patients with typhoid\\r\\n    have passed successively through camp, field, evacuation, and\\r\\n    base hospitals without any documentary evidence that typhoid or\\r\\n    paratyphoid was even suspected. There are records of a stay of\\r\\n    two weeks or more in a single base hospital without diagnosis,\\r\\n    and not a few records are on file showing that it remained for\\r\\n    the pathologist to make the diagnosis at the autopsy table.”\\r\\n\\r\\n    “The vaccinated individual protected against general systemic\\r\\n    infection may still act as a carrier of typhoid infection,\\r\\n    and frequently shows clinical manifestations of local disease\\r\\n    of some portion of the gastrointestinal tract, while the\\r\\n    characteristic symptom complex of typhoid fever due to general\\r\\n    infection, namely, continued fever, rose spots, and enlarged\\r\\n    spleen, may be wholly absent.”\\r\\n\\r\\n    “Many cases originally diagnosed as influenza in the American\\r\\n    Expeditionary Forces have subsequently proven to be typhoid.”\\r\\n\\r\\n    “Intestinal types of supposed influenza should always be\\r\\n    considered as possible typhoid until proven otherwise.”\\r\\n\\r\\n    “The frequency with which atypical, mild, unrecognized cases\\r\\n    of typhoid and paratyphoid fever has occurred in the American\\r\\n    Expeditionary Forces among vaccinated men makes it absolutely\\r\\n    essential to surround all such cases of undetermined fever with\\r\\n    the same precautions which it is found necessary to apply to\\r\\n    established typhoid or paratyphoid patients, to avoid contact\\r\\n    infections in the wards among other patients and hospital\\r\\n    personnel.”\\r\\n\\r\\n    “Several protocols have been received in which the complete\\r\\n    pathological and bacteriological pictures of typhoid fever were\\r\\n    recorded but the cause of death was entered as ‘peritonitis,’\\r\\n    ‘perforation of the intestine,’ ‘broncho-pneumonia,’ ‘acute\\r\\n    enterocolitis.’”\\r\\n\\r\\n    “Typhoid fever is increasing in the American Expeditionary\\r\\n    Forces--so are the paratyphoid fevers.”\\r\\n\\r\\n    “Vaccination is a partial protection only and must be\\r\\n    reinforced by sanitary measures.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIt will be noted that not only does the above official Report contain\\r\\na frank, full, and free admission of the outright and inexcusable\\r\\nfailure of typhoid vaccination to protect from typhoid fever where it\\r\\nis most needed, viz., where “sanitary precautions” do not exist, but\\r\\nit also clearly shows some other serious evils which I have repeatedly\\r\\ncharged to the practice of compulsory vaccination, viz., it shows\\r\\nhow frequently false diagnoses are made of vaccinated cases, either\\r\\nwilfully or inadvertently, so as to conceal the actual occurrence\\r\\nof typhoid fever in vaccinated men and report it as some other\\r\\ndisease, such as “Influenza,” etc., and thus conceal the failures\\r\\nof vaccination. It also shows that many cases of death from typhoid\\r\\nfever in vaccinated men are reported as not due to this disease but\\r\\nto some of its terminals or complications such as “Peritonitis,”\\r\\n“Broncho-Pneumonia,” “Enterocolitis,” etc. By these mistaken, or\\r\\nwilfully false, reports, the failures, dangers and fatalities of\\r\\nvaccination are often concealed and denied, thus verifying my charge of\\r\\nserious medical falsification in these matters, which I have openly and\\r\\npublicly stated for years past and challenged denial or disproof.\\r\\n\\r\\nEXAMPLE SEVENTH. Failure of Typhoid Vaccination in the U. S. Army in\\r\\nAmerica.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the _Journal of the American Medical Association_ for February\\r\\n15, 1919, there is a report of a bad epidemic of Typhoid Fever which\\r\\noccurred among the vaccinated men in Camp Greene, Charlotte, North\\r\\nCarolina, in June, 1918. In this case infection is reported to have\\r\\ncome from ice cream which the men had eaten, and the rather pitiable\\r\\nand ridiculous excuse is given for the failure of the vaccination in\\r\\nthis case, that the infection in the ice cream was so virulent or in\\r\\nsuch “massive doses” that the protective power of the vaccination\\r\\nwas not sufficient to overcome such “massive” infection, and hence\\r\\nthe vaccination failed to protect the men and they succumbed to the\\r\\ndisease, notwithstanding their extensive and repeated vaccination! This\\r\\nis, of course, another and equally positive admission of the failure\\r\\nof typhoid vaccination, but, unlike the previous example, it is a\\r\\nrather ridiculous or farcical admission, as it attempts to excuse\\r\\nthe failure by saying that the “doses” of infection in the ice cream\\r\\nwere so “massive” that the vaccination was overpowered and could not\\r\\nbe expected to overcome such odds! In other words, vaccination will\\r\\nprotect you where there is no dangerous or serious infection to be\\r\\nguarded against, but will fail where any serious or “massive” doses of\\r\\ninfection are present! This is equivalent to saying that vaccination\\r\\nis a good policeman for any town where there are no lawbreakers and no\\r\\ndisorder, but is no good where there is any serious crime, violence\\r\\nor danger. Vaccination, we are thus told, is a good bulletproof armor\\r\\nprovided you shoot only pop-guns against it, but it is no good to\\r\\nresist real pistol or rifle balls! This is just about what opponents\\r\\nof compulsory vaccination have been contending for years, and this is\\r\\ntherefore one of the chief reasons why we now contend that no such\\r\\nineffective, unreliable and dangerous remedy should be forced on any\\r\\nperson, child or adult, against free will and consent.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSUMMING UP--THE CASE PROVED\\r\\n\\r\\nTo sum up briefly, I think it may now be seen that our several cardinal\\r\\npoints against the evils of Compulsory Vaccination have been proved by\\r\\nimpregnable legal, medical and historical facts and out of the mouth of\\r\\nhigh authorities on vaccination. These cardinal points may be stated in\\r\\nseven numbers as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n    FIRST: The illegality and unconstitutionality of all compulsory\\r\\n    vaccination and its gross violation of Medical Freedom and\\r\\n    Bodily Sanctity, which are unalienable American rights equal\\r\\n    with Religious Freedom.\\r\\n\\r\\n    SECOND: The medical barbarism and malpractice of all compulsory\\r\\n    medicine and compulsory disease as being opposed to all true\\r\\n    standards of medical ethics and logic.\\r\\n\\r\\n    THIRD: The poor protective power of vaccination, which gives no\\r\\n    immunity from smallpox except for short periods of a few months\\r\\n    or a year and requires frequent repetition, which is obviously\\r\\n    ineffective as a protection and dangerous as a remedy.\\r\\n\\r\\n    FOURTH: That sanitation, isolation and hygiene have been and\\r\\n    are the chief means of preventing and suppressing smallpox\\r\\n    epidemics independent of vaccination.\\r\\n\\r\\n    FIFTH: That vaccination is very dangerous to health and life,\\r\\n    causes epidemics in animals and mankind and is oftentimes more\\r\\n    fatal than smallpox and now causes more deaths than smallpox.\\r\\n\\r\\n    SIXTH: That vaccinating doctors and health officials most\\r\\n    shamefully deny and conceal injuries and deaths from\\r\\n    vaccination and falsify our vital statistics accordingly.\\r\\n\\r\\n    SEVENTH: That the practice of inflicting on the human body a\\r\\n    compulsory medical disease, which is dangerous to health and\\r\\n    life and causes many deaths every year, is obviously illegal\\r\\n    and a medical crime on the people which must be suppressed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCONCLUSION\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon, therefore, as this crushing fact of the great danger of\\r\\nvaccination to human health and life enters the mind and conscience\\r\\nof the mass of the people, and is fully grasped by the legislative,\\r\\nthe judicial and the executive minds of the country--from whom it\\r\\nhas been so long concealed by medical falsehood in high places--this\\r\\nenlightenment will, I firmly believe, result in the permanent\\r\\nabolishment of all compulsory vaccination, if not in the penal\\r\\nprohibition of general vaccination, as being now more dangerous\\r\\nthan natural smallpox; and to that great fact and to this final and\\r\\nprophetic thought, Mr. President, I ask your careful attention in\\r\\nclosing this exposure of vaccination horrors and medical mendacities.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Respectfully submitted,\\r\\n  CHAS.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\r\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without\\r\\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\\r\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\r\\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\\r\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\\r\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\r\\nstatus with the IRS.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\r\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\r\\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\r\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\r\\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\\r\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\\r\\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\\r\\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\r\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\r\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\r\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\r\\n\\r\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\r\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\r\\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\\r\\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\\r\\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\\r\\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works\\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\\r\\nGutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be\\r\\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\\r\\ndistributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of\\r\\nvolunteer support.\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed\\r\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\\r\\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\\r\\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\\r\\nedition.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\\r\\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\\r\\n\\r\\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,\\r\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\r\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\r\\n\""
